Gnumeric Spread Sheet task list

* Cell editing

   Pressing F4 when editing a cell formula, should switch a cell
   reference in the following cycle:

     A4 -> $A$4 -> $A4 -> A$4 -> A4

* Even More Functions

   GROWTH, LINEST, LOGEST, PERCENTILE, MMULT, MDETERM,
   QUARTILE, TREND, ERROR.TYPE.

   (This is not a claim that these are all.)

* Printing
  * Screen layout is broken for right justified text.
  * Save print information in workbook
  * Load print information from workbook
  * Preview
  * Print setup: 
    * Implement Print Preview, Options buttons
    * Improve layout 
    * Provide GUI for margin editing.
  * Add headers and footers
  * Add left, middle right header/footer support
  * Add "repeat on top" support.
  * Add font selector to the cell format.
  * Add the missing options to the Print Dialog
  * Display printing status (pages to go).
  * Add column/row title printing
  * Add color printing support.

* Cell range naming

   Finish implementing.

* Cell dimension computation is broken on font change for multilines.

* Number formatting

   The formatting code should take the current GtkFont for the cell
   being formatted as well as the width allowed and take this into
   account to render the number as well as possible given the space so
   that for small regions, numbers in scientific notation are displayed.

* Sheet

** Cell data entry:
   double click on cell allows editing as in main editing box.

* Auditing
   Write the sheet auditing code.

* Searching

   Searching text on the spreadhseet.

* EDITION

** Object Clipboard
   If sheet->mode is OBJECT_SELECTED cut/copy/paste should operate on
   the object.

   Object properties.

** Paste special 

  needs some little changes:
  - When formulas are pasted with an operation,
    the new ExprTree should be created with the operation.

** Style

  Borders:

  Color/patterns

  Protection:
    Bloqued/Hidden

** Keyboard shortcuts

* File Load/Save

  Support for popular formats.  

    I have the specs for the XS3 format.  SC should be
    trivial to support as well (from the guile sources)

  Add "hints" to the file save routine based on the registered
  formats.

* Display Engine

* Unicode support throughout

* Workbooks:

** Notebook:

   Clicking on it chooses it
   Double clicking changes the name
   Right clicking gets:
     insert

* Excel importing

   BIFF_NOTE ( comments ) importing.

   BIFF_OBJ: Embedded objects. S59DAD.HTM

   Re-engineer to use PtrArrays in several places instead
   of hashing on an integer: speedup.

   Fix odd integer formatting hiding some numbers,

   Sort cycadelic colours.

   Add collation of BIFF continuation records to the
   previous record, to save many checks in the code.

   Get correct RK values for _tiny_ floats coming through.

   * Formulae
   
      Sort out PtgRefN family, convert to correct posn.

   Get Nested OLE object streams working nicely.

* OLE

   Integrate into libvfs.
   Update to better understanding of file, see wine.

* Sheets

When adding a sheet or renaming a sheet, should we reparse everything?

* Clipboard

Perhaps make a global clipboard and remove all the hacks in the
current clipboard code to find the clipboard.

* Sheet Objects

Rewrite the entire support for sheet objects.  I do not like the code
at *all*.
