This directory is *shared* between a lot of modules in GNOME CVS -
which means that every change you're doing here immediately affects
a very large number of modules.

Please, do *ALWAYS ASK FIRST* on gnome-hackers@gnome.org before you
commit anything to this directory. If unsure, feel free to send me
a patch <martin@gnome.org> and I'll commit it for you it it's ok.

Thanks for your understanding,
