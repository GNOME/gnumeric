# BEMÆRK at tekster fra 'command.c' skal oversættes med navneord og ikke

#   fortryd/gentag: 'handlingstekst'
#
#
# Konventioner:
#
# sheet -> ark
# workbook -> arbejdsbog
# evaluate -> finde værdien af
# range -> interval, (dog til tider) omfang
# plugin -> [udvidelses]modul (indstik el. lign. bliver for kryptisk)
# constraint -> begrænsning (fx "x < 10")
# truncate -> afkorte (fx 2.79 -> 2)
# validate -> gyldighedskontrol
# array -> matrix, vektor
# custom -> selvvalgt, brugerdefineret (afhængig af sammenhæng)
# paste special -> avanceret indsætning
# df (degree freedom) -> fg (frihedsgrader)
# formulae/formulas -> formler (ikke "formularer", altså "blanketter")
#
# Formater og formatér er med ét 't'. Eksemplerne under tekstrutinerne
# er danskificerede. Den mærkelige mani med at sætte et mellemrum foran
# kolon (som i "Cell :") er ikke bevaret i oversættelserne.
#
# Læg mærke til de omkringstående tekster, især i forbindelse med
# hjælpeteksterne til de indbyggede funktioner i Gnumeric, f.eks. bruges
#
#   equals -> er lig med
#
# i stedet for f.eks. blot "lig" eller "lig med" eller "er lig".
