"@database is a range of cells in which rows of related information are "

"\n"
"@field specifies which column is used in the function.  If @field is an "

"``Age'' in @database range. \n"
"\n"
"@criteria is the range of cells which contains the specified conditions.  "
"The first row of a @criteria should contain the labels of the fields for "
"which the criterias are for.  Cells below the labels specify conditions, for "
"example, ``>3'' or ``<9''.  Equality condition can be given simply by "
"specifing a value, e.g. ``3'' or ``John''.  Each row in @criteria specifies "
"a separate condition, i.e. if a row in @database matches with one of the "
"rows in @criteria then that row is counted in (technically speaking boolean "
"OR between the rows in @criteria).  If @criteria specifies more than one "
