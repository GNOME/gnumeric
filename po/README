If you are working on translating Gnumeric, please read the file
doc/translating.sgml for details on some issues regarding Gnumeric.

"File/Print preview" and "Print preview" has to be translated with the
same word for "Print preview" otherwise the recent opened sheets menu
will *NOT* show up! This is important, so please check.

Also the File part needs to be translated like in the gnome-libs po file
ie, in danish the GNOMEUIINFO_MENU_FILE_TREE in gnome-libs uses 'Filer'.

So Danish, should be "Filer/Vis udskrift" and not "Fil/Vis udskrift" for
instance.
