"\n"
"With the simulation tool and the SIMTABLE function you can test given "

"simulation variable. In most valid simulation models you should have the "
"same number of values @dN for all decision variables.  If the simulation is "

"The successive use of the simulation tool also requires that you give to the "
"tool at least one input variable having RAND() or any other "
"RAND<distribution name>() function in it. On each round, the simulation tool "
"iterates for the given number of rounds over all the input variables to "
"reevaluate them. On each iteration, the values of the output variables are "
"stored, and when the round is completed, descriptive statistical information "
"is created according to the values.\n"
