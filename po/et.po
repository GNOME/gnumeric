"@SYNTAX=DAVERAGE(database,field,criteria)\n"
"@DESCRIPTION=DAVERAGE function returns the average of the values in a list "

"\n"
"@database is a range of cells in which rows of related information are "
"records and columns of data are fields. The first row of a database contains "
"labels for each column. \n"
"\n"
"@field specifies which column is used in the function.  If @field is an "
"integer, for example. 2, the second column is used. Field can also be the "
"label of a column.  For example, ``Age'' refers to the column with the label "
"``Age'' in @database range. \n"
"\n"
"@criteria is the range of cells which contains the specified conditions.  "
"The first row of a @criteria should contain the labels of the fields for "
"which the criterias are for.  Cells below the labels specify conditions, for "
"example, ``>3'' or ``<9''.  Equality condition can be given simply by "
"specifing a value, e.g. ``3'' or ``John''.  Each row in @criteria specifies "
"a separate condition, i.e. if a row in @database matches with one of the "
"rows in @criteria then that row is counted in (technically speaking boolean "
"OR between the rows in @criteria).  If @criteria specifies more than one "
"columns then each of the conditions in these columns should be true that the "

"@DESCRIPTION=DVARP function returns the variance of a population based on "
"the entire populations. The populations consists of numbers that match "
"conditions specified.\n"
"\n"
"@database is a range of cells in which rows of related information are "
"records and columns of data are fields. The first row of a database contains "
"labels for each column. \n"
"\n"
"@field specifies which column is used in the function.  If @field is an "
"integer, for example. 2, the second column is used. Field can also be the "
"label of a column.  For example, ``Age'' refers to the column with the label "
"``Age'' in @database range. \n"
"\n"
"@criteria is the range of cells which contains the specified conditions.  "
"The first row of a @criteria should contain the labels of the fields for "
"which the criterias are for.  Cells below the labels specify conditions, for "
"example, ``>3'' or ``<9''.  Equality condition can be given simply by "
"specifing a value, e.g. ``3'' or ``John''.  Each row in @criteria specifies "
"a separate condition, i.e. if a row in @database matches with one of the "
"rows in @criteria then that row is counted in (technically speaking boolean "
"OR between the rows in @criteria).  If @criteria specifies more than one "
"columns then each of the conditions in these columns should be true that the "
"row in @database matches (again technically speaking boolean AND between the "
"columns in each row in @criteria). \n"
