<A NAME="whatis"></A>What is Gnumeric</H3>

The Gnumeric spreadsheet is part of the <A
HREF="http://www.gnome.org">GNOME</A> desktop environment: a project
to create a free, user friendly desktop environment.&nbsp; As every
other component of GNOME, Gnumeric is <A
HREF="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free
software</A>&nbsp; and it is licensed under the terms of the GNU <A
HREF="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GPL.</A> 

<P>You can see some <A
HREF="http://www.gnome.org/gnumeric/screenshots">screenshots</A> of
Gnumeric.

<hr>
<h3>Breaking news!</h3>
Gnumeric on the CVS has the printing code merged finally into the HEAD
of the CVS.  I am polishing the printing code and I will be releasing
Gnumeric 0.28 shortly.  Stay tuned.

<p>
<P>Gnumeric is intended to be a replacement for a commercial
spreadsheet, so a lot of effort and work has still to go into it, but
I believe we have the right framework to do it.

<h3>
<a name="download"></a>Downloading</h3>

You can download gnumeric from: <a
href="ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/gnumeric">ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/gnumeric</a>

<P>Gnumeric announcements:
<ul>

<H3>
<A NAME="future"></A>Future projects</H3>

I would like to add support for arbitrary precision arithmetic in the
future using the GNU Multi-precision library.

<P>To learn more about our plans read the README and the Future-Roadmap files 
included with Gnumeric.

<p>Graphics in Gnumeric will be implemented by using the <a
href="/guppi">GUPPI</a> plotting engine through the CORBA and Bonobo
infrastructure.  To test drive the code that includes Bonobo support
you need to get a copy of Bonobo (this is not yet released, you need
to get a snapshot from the CVS, using the command "cvs co bonobo".  Be
warned that until Bonobo's release we are not commiting to any sort of
support on Gnumeric).

<p> Michael Meeks, Jody Goldberg and Sean Atkinson are working on
the import / export code.  Talk to them if you are interested in helping the
project.

<H3>
<A NAME="corba"></A>CORBA, compound documents</H3>

As part of the GNOME desktop, Gnumeric will be using the <A
HREF="http://cvs.labs.redhat.com/ORBit">ORBit</A> CORBA implementation
to expose its services to the world. It will also be available to other
applications as a Baboon component
(Baboon is the compound document architecture of GNOME).

<H3>
<A NAME="plugin"></A>Plugin system</H3>

Gnumeric has a plugin system based on shared libraries right now
(which means that all plugins right now fall under the GNU GPL). A
plugin exists for defining your own functions in Python.<P>

Gnumeric exports a number of CORBA interfaces that enable programmers
to control Gnumeric remotely within an authenticated GNOME desktop

<H3>
<A NAME="lists"></A>Mailing lists</H3>

The Gnumeric mailing list can be reached at <A
HREF="mailto:gnumeric-list@gnome.org">gnumeric-list@gnome.org</A>.  If
you want to subscribe to the mailing list, send mail to: <A
HREF="mailto:gnumeric-list-request@gnome.org">gnumeric-list-request@gnome.org</A>
and in the body of your message put the word "subscribe". The lists are also <A
HREF="http://www.gnome.org/mailing-lists/archives/gnumeric-list/">archived</A>.
Please read some <A HREF="mailing-list.html">advice</A> before sending mail.

<H3>
<A NAME="getting"></A>Getting Gnumeric</H3>

As with any other software in GNOME, you can fetch the latest
development version of Gnumeric from the <A
HREF="http://www.gnome.org/devel/whatiscvs.shtml">GNOME Anonymous
CVS</A> and from the GNOME CVS from the module "gnumeric".  <P>To
compile Gnumeric you will need the gnome-libs package and the
gnome-xml package. The gnome-libs package in turn requires the glib, gtk+
and imlib packages.

<H3>
<A NAME="bugs"></A>Reporting Bugs</H3>

Firstly, please make sure that you have the latest version of gnumeric before
reporting bugs. Gnumeric is undergoing extensive and rapid development and your
bug is likely to have been silently fixed.

<P>The standard procedure for bug reporting is detailed at <A
HREF="http://bugs.gnome.org/">http://bugs.gnome.org/</A> please ensure that
your bug hasn't already been logged by checking the <A
HREF="http://bugs.gnome.org/db/pa/lgnumeric.html">list</A>.
It would also help if you CC. your mail to gnumeric-list@gnome.org.

<P>There are certain types of bug that we are especially interested in. Gnumeric
should <b>never</b> die (SEGV) if it does please, please put the effort in 
to submit a bug report, it will save others lots of grief.

<h3>
<a name="support">Contractual support</h3>

International GNOME support (IGS) provides <a
href="http://www.gnome-support.com">contractual support</a> for
Gnumeric for any extensions, or special developments you might need
from Gnumeric.
<p>
All the code written by IGS is released under the terms of the GNU
GPL.  If the code extension is general enough you extension might be
folded into the main Gnumeric distribution. 
<p>

<H3>
<A NAME="Thanks">Thanks to</a></H3>

Tom Miller at <a href="http://www.xess.com">XESS</a> for helping me
understand various spreadsheet issues and making the source code for
his first spreadsheet program available to me for study.  <p>

<h3>Developers</h3>
Gnumeric has been coded mainly by Miguel de Icaza, with help from 
other intrepid hackers that have contributed code, bug fixes and
documentation:
<ul>
	<li>Daniel Veillard (XML file load/save support).
	<li>Tom Dyas (Plugin setup, Python plugin).
	<li>Michael Meeks, Jody Goldberg, Sean Atkinson and Bruno Unna (Excel file loading code).
	<li>Jukka-Pekka Iivonen (lots of Gnumeric's functions).
	<li>Jakub Jelinek (new scrolling engine)
	<li>Chris Lahey (number formatting engine).
	<li>Adrian Likins (manual, online help).
	<li>Vladimir Vuksan (various Gnumeric functions).
