Gnumeric 0.3 "Computing Bonobo" has been released for your spreadsheet
pleasure. This version features a number of enhancements over the
last release. I am sure you want to upgrade as soon as possible. 

o Support for cut and paste through the X selection.

o Auto-convert-on-input features: When you enter text in Gnumeric
it is now matched against the known formats of Gnumeric and if
possible, converted to a (number, format) pair. This works
when you enter a formula and when you type in text.

This means you can use now dates and times in expressions, like
this: ="10-Jan"+45. 

Autofill will also work on this.

o Working python module with sample python function. 

o Much more documentation (thanks a lot to Adrian Likins
for all the effort he has put into documenting Gnumeric). A
general introduction to Gnumeric is include as well, as
sections on editing, formulas, autofill and drag and drop is included

o Fixes for the teams doing internationalization. A document
describing the guidelines to translate certain parts of
Gnumeric is included.

o Lots of bug fixes. 

Where to get it from:

GNU packages:

ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources

CVS:

gnumeric module, tag GNUMERIC_0_3

Cheers,
Miguel.
