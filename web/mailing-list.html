<BLOCKQUOTE>
    - If you include a signature keep it short.  Rule of thumb
      is no longer than 4 lines.  Remember that many people pay for
      connectivity by the minute, and the longer your message is,
      the more they pay.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
    - Be brief without being overly terse.  When replying to a message,
      include enough original material to be understood but no more. It
      is extremely bad form to simply reply to a message by including
      all the previous message: edit out all the irrelevant material.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
    - Mail should have a subject heading which reflects
      the content of the message.

<H3>Signature separators</H3>
	There is a standard for signature files ( link eludes me just now ) but it stipulates the following. Any signature should have as its first line:<P>
<CENTER>
<B>'-- '</B>
</CENTER><P>
The quotes are omitted, and there should be no other characters beyond a CR/LF on this line.<P>
eg.
