Gnumeric -- The GNOME spreadsheet
Jody Goldberg <jody@gnome.org>

The project aims to become a drop in replacement for proprietary spreadsheets.
If you are interested in contributing to its development please send us some
email, there are lots of projects available.

Random notes
------------
[Hopelessly outdated -- ignore for now]


This is a partial list of Features implemented in Gnumeric, we need
documentation for these:

	- Autofill
		Number autofill (computes delta, autofills from that).
	 	String autofill (daynames, months are built in).
		String+Number combo integer autofill.
		Formula autofill.

	- Drag and drop selection
		Select an area and use the border to drag the
	 	contents (shift/control/alt are modifiers to copy
		or move)

	- Selection
		- Multiple selections are supported, hold down control
		  key to augment the existing selection (they can be
		  discontinuous).

		- Walking selection.
		  Use return/tab and shift-return/shift-tab to capture
		  information in a selection.

		- Fill quickly a region with the same text: just enter
		  the text in a selection and press control-enter.

	- Number formatting
		- The formatting of numbers is very powerful, we
		  emulate the Excel number formatting specification.

		- Format rules: you can use rules to specify which
		  format to use.

		- Format colors: you can specify a color to format
		  within the format.

		- Conditional colours and format strings.

	- Column/Row resizing
		- Drag the column/row division to adjust the column
		  and row dimensions.

		- To make changes to various columns/rows
		  simultaneously, select the columns and then change
		  the dimension of one of them.

	- Content
		- Merged Cells
		- Array formulas

	- Filters
		- MS OfficeOpenXML 	Read/Write
		- MS Excel (95 -> 2003)	Read/Write
		- MS Excel (v2 -> v4)	Read
		- Applix (v4 & v5)	Read
		- Quattro Pro (v1-v3)	Read
		- Planperfect		Read
		- Lotus (wk1)		Read
		- OpenOffice.org/ODF	Read/Write
		- html (3.2 & 4.0)	Read
		- html (4.0, xhtml)	Write
		- Latex 		Write
		- Troff 		Write
		- DIF			Read
		- SYLK			Read/Write
		- Oleo			Read
		- SC			Read
		- MPS Optimizer files	Read

	- To edit the contents of a cell that already has a value,
	  press F2 key.

	- When typing a formula, you can use the cursor keys to select
	  a cell or a cell range in the expression.  This will only
	  work if a cell name is valid at the cursor point.

	  To specify a cell range, just move to the start of the cell
	  range and then hold down the shift key while making the size
	  of the selection cursor bigger.

	- An expression is evaluated constantly on top of the current
	  selection.  There is a number of pre-defined auto-compute
	  expressions, you can change this by right clicking on this
	  expression (it is on the bottom right corner).

	- If you drag a selection with button 3 instead of button one
	  there is no default action, rather, a menu pops up with
	  a list of possible options on actions to perform.

	- Gnumeric distinguishes regular text from formulas by preceding
	  formulas with an equal sign.  So to enter an expression you have
	  to enter for example: =1+2.

	- Control-A selects all.
	- Alt-Space selects the row.
	- Control-Space selects a column.

	- Selection-keys + control extend the selection to boundary of
	  worksheet.

	- Shift-Backspace:  Collapses selection to active cell.

	- Home: move to the beginning of the row.

	- Control-Home: move to the cell A1

	- Control-Enter: copies current edit text to the selected range.

	- Control-Shift-Enter: If there is a single range selected and the
	  current edit text is a formula, the formula is made into an
	  'array-formula'.

	- Control-Pg{Up,Down}: Switch to the previous/next worksheet.
	- Alt-Pg{Up,Down}: Page left and right.
	- Mouse-Wheel : scroll up/down
	- Alt-Mouse-Wheel : scroll left-right
	- Arrow+ScrollLock

     o Frozen Panes (including Horizontal or Vertical only)

     o Auto-convert-on-input features: When you enter text in Gnumeric
       it is now matched against the known formats of Gnumeric and if
       possible, converted to a (number, format) pair.  This works
       when you enter a formula and when you type in text.

       This means you can use now dates and times in expressions, like
       this: ="10-Jan"+45.  However, just because you can does not
       mean you should!  If you send a spreadsheet like this to someone
       else whose computer is set to a different locale, then there
       is no guarantee that the string will be interpreted in the
       same way.

       Autofill will also work on this.
