Gnumeric 0.25
Hello guys,

   Gnumeric 0.25 has been released.  Lots of new things are happening
in this new version, here is a list:

* User visible

	* New functions: BETADIST(), FDIST(), TDIST(), CHIDIST(),
	  CHIINV(), GAMMAINV(), GAMMADIST() from Jukka-Pekka.

	* New functions: SUMSQ(), MULTINOMIAL(), PRODUCT(), SQRTPI().
	  I believe these are from Jukka Pekka, but I do not see a
	  ChangeLog entry.

	* Enhanced Excel importing code even more (Michael Meeks).

	* Goal seek dialog box from Jukka-Pekka works.

	* Round up bug fixed by Morten Welinder.

	* Recomputation bugs for cell ranges fixed (some taxpayers
	  noticed that their loaded sheets were not recalculating at
	  startup, thanks for their input).

* User visible, not ready

	* More Bonobo work.  Start of graphics wizard for use with
	  Guppi, the GNOME plotting engine.


* Foundation work

	* Integration of libglade into Gnumeric.  Now we can design
	  our dialog boxes with Glade and use libglade to load the
	  GUIs.  Thanks to Damon Chaplin for Glade and James
	  Henstridge for libglade and his support with libglade.

	* Made the code use 'const' a lot more (Morten Welinder), this
	  helps making the code more robust.

* Not very visible

	* Assorted batch of bug fixes.

	* A number of memory leaks have been fixed (Morten Welinder).

	* Excel loader can even restore your selection :-) (Michael
	  Meeks).

	* A number of sanity checks from Morten Welinder.

Miguel.


Gnumeric 0.23
Hello guys!

   A new version of Gnumeric has been released, version 0.23.  Trained
eyes will notice that I have skipped version 0.22.  Well, I did not.
I just did not announce it because I had promised not to make a new
release (which I ended up doing) because it included a pile of cool
features.

   So, here is the new stuff since 0.21, major features:

	* Michael Meeks added multiple-clause sort to the sort dialog.

	* GNUMERIC_NORMDIST() function now uses a more efficient
	  method of computation (Morten Wellinder).

	* Should load properly workbooks with references to other
	  sheets.

	* Starts up with a bigger size (Michael).

	* Michael has begun a function wizard, it is disabled in this
	  version by default.

	* RAND() function.

	* Fixes for some cases of circular references (the other cases
	  were fine), by Morten.

	* IF() now can take variable arguments (Michael).

	* Updated documentation

	* Many small fixes.

Gnumeric 0.21
Hello guys,

   I know, I know.  Too many releases for a day.

   But many good things have been done, and we want all of these
features to be available ASAP to all of you :-).

	1. Morten Welinder implemented a more accurrate algorithm for
	   the variance functions.

	2. Michael Meeks send me lots of updates and changes to Gnumeric:

		a. Column Sorting.
		b. Better dragging of text areas.
		c. Updated documentation on writing functions.
		d. Uses floats on number-entry if the number is
	  	   too large (instead of overflowing like it was doing).
		e. Updated function documentation to mention optional parameters.

   I promise I will be quiet now for a few days.  I really do.

Gnumeric 0.18
Hello guys,

   New gnumeric is out.

   This is mainly a bug fix release

* Features:

	- More functions from Michael Meeks

	- Bug fix: Applying a cell number format should work again inmediately
	  (it was not queuing the re-rendering operation).

	  same-priority but different meaning operations.

	  Should work now. (ie, it will correctly decode 1/(c4*d4)
	  again.

	- New code: integer overflow/underflow detection code.  Now
	  addition and substraction will be promoted to floating point

Gnumeric 0.14
Hey guys!

   This is the release of Gnumeric "Simplified Bonobo" 0.14.

   The only difference between Gnumeric 0.13 and 0.14 is that 0.14
ships in a way that makes the install process use the documentation as
it was generated in my machine (that means, you do not need the
Docbook tools installed in your system to get the documentation).

Best wishes,

Hello guys,

   Gnumeric "International Manatee" 0.8 has been released.

   This version is available in:

	ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/gnumeric-0.8.tar.gz

   The most important change in International Manatee is the fact that
the documentation that Adrian Likins wrote is now integrated into the
build system.  It gets installed and we feature a reference guide for
the internal Gnumeric functions.

   These are the features of International Manatee:

	- Bruno enabled the coloring page for setting the foreground

	  sheet label name.

	- Guile support now needs to be explicitly configure
	  (--with-guile).

	- Fix crashing problems repoted when autofilling.

	- Documentation is included in the tarball (You need DocBook
	  if you plan on extending the documentation or fixing my
	  ugly, ugly, ugly stuff :-).  You can find Docbook here:

		ftp://ftp.cygnus.com/pub/home/rosalia/docware.

	  A docbook tutorial is available in:

		http://nis-www.lanl.gov/~rosalia/mydocs/docbook-intro.html

	  The full docbook documentation can be downloaded for free
	  from the Davenport site (I lost the url to this, but I am
	  confident all of you documentation-savvy people are good
	  at altavistaing things).

Enjoy,
Miguel.

Gnumeric 0.5
Hello guys,

   I have just released a new version of Gnumeric (gnumeric-0.5), this
version is available in:

	ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/gnumeric-0.5.tar.gz

   The highlights of this version are:

	  code to add your file loader anymore, routines are provided
	  to register file loading and saving formats.

	- (bug fix) Fixed the broken storage setup I introduced in the
	  previous version.  This means that files are now correctly
	  loaded and that if an expression renders an error you will
	  still be able to access the information you stored.

Enjoy this new version,
Miguel


Gnumeric 0.4
From miguel Wed Dec 16 23:16:34 -0600 1998
From: Miguel de Icaza <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>
To: gnumeric-list@gnome.org
Subject: New version of Gnumeric has been released.
X-Lost: In case of doubt, make it sound convincing


Hello guys,

   A new version of Gnumeric has been released as part of the GNOME
libraries code freeze.

   I have not been very active the last two months in Gnumeric due to
the freezing of GNOME (I worked a lot on the file manager issues), but
I will soon be back working in the spreadsheet.

   Michael Meeks and Bruno Unna did an awesome job while I was doing
this: They added Excel file importing.  That is all I can say.  Some
stuff is missing, yes, it will get added, yes.

   During the last few weeks Morten Welinder has been reviewing the
Gnumeric code and making very good suggestions to the coding style as
well as making sure we keep Gnumeric in a nice way.  I am very
thankful for his input.

   Jakub Jelinek made the scrolling code be smarter than my previous
attempt at scrolling, it is now definetly usable.

   Code for attaching notes to cell is completely on the code.  The
only problem is that right now comment is hardcoded in the source
code.  We need a nice dialog box for this.

   Mark Probst added some Guile support (this as well as the other
plugins is completely optional), some neat things can be done with it,
make sure you check the distribution directory.

   Exponentiation has been implemented (all the code was there, I just
had forgotten to add the line to the grammar).

   Some more architectural work has been going on: named-cell range
code is there (not finished but there).  Also, some code for
referencing the cells in other sheets or workbook is there.

   I still need to figure out a way to encode this into the
expression.  I would appreciate any input on this issue: There are
various possible solutions, one of the is creating a special OP_ that
would represent a lookup into an non-local sheet.  The other is to
define this as a function and finally, it could be done as a special
cell type.

   Also, I have dropped the "entered_text" information I kept on the
cell.  Now the cell value is stored either as a value or as an
expression tree and decoded when the user requires it.  This was
required for a number of things (one of them being a nicer way to
share cell expressions during copying, and for the excel format and
the autofill code got definetly simpler and more maintainable).

   Various display and scrolling glitches were fixed as well.  But in
the process, I somehow broke the object-drawing code.  I have not
researched this yet.

   The initial support for CORBA is in, but it does not actually do
anything, it is just the setup for launching the Gnumeric server.
Owen Taylor made Gnumeric accept dragged files, you can now drag files
from the file manager into the spreadsheet, on this topic:  the date
routiens now use GLib's gdate instead of the gnome-libs libDate
routines.

   You can fetch it from:

      ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/gnumeric-0.4.tar.gz

Enjoy,
Miguel.
