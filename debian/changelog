      only supports one chart per graph and just one title. When exporting to

gnumeric (1.1.16-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * First upload of gnumeric 1.1.x to sid. While 1.1.x is still a development
    series, it is sufficiently mature in both upstream's and my opinion for
    inclusion in sid. It still lacks graphing capabilities. If you require
    those, use the gnumeric1.0 packages.
  * Many bugs were fixed during 1.1.x development:
    * Signedness issues (Closes: #1628292)
    * Integration into the GNOME object activation framework. 
      (Closes: #128635)
    * Icons when using a light-on-dark theme. (Closes: #106544)

    * Overly zealous autocompletion. (Closes: #140988)
    * Checking of errors on write. (Closes: #147093)
    * Hardcoded font descriptor. (Closes: #147797)
    * Warning messages on with euro locale. (Closes: #150860)
    * Loss of monetary data formatting with euros. (Closes: #151520)
    * Locale-dependent decimal point in LaTeX export. (Closes: #152950)

    * Parentheses with summation button. (Closes: #163820)
    * Broken defined name information in Excel export. (Closes: #176025)
    * Window too wide with xinerama. (Closes: #102699)
    * Assertion failures with print preview. (Closes: #150280, #169080)
    * Unfortunate format for result of subtracting dates. (Closes: #150783)
    * Bad user interface design for sheet handling. (Closes: #99815, #112520)
    * Superfluous question when exporting the only sheet. (Closes: #149605)
    * Lack of Lotus 1-2-3 import filter. (Closes: #175427)
  * [debian/control]
    * Added Conflicts, Replaces for the corresponding gnumeric1.0 packages.
    * Dropped guppi-gnumeric, evolution suggestions as the GNOME2 port can't
      take advantage of those (yet).
    * Suggest yelp rather than gnome-help as yelp, unlike gnome-help, handles
      DocBook XML.
  * Fixed some issues noted by Johannes Rohr:
    * [debian/rules] Actually install gnumeric-component.
    * Fixed the path to gnumeric-component in 
      /usr/lib/bonobo/servers/GNOME_Gnumeric.server .

      bumped libgnomeprint-dev build dependency to a version that declares a 
      dependency on libfreetype6-dev.

      Added a dependency on a recent enough gnome-libs-data known to include 
      that file to prevent these problems. (Closes: #117983)
    * Tightened the libgnomeprint-dev build dependency as older versions may
      segfault in their postinst, causing build failures with the build 
      daemons.
    * Temporarily added build dependency on libfreetype6-dev which is needed 
      for gnome-print but not yet declared by libgnomeprint-dev.
    * Changed Suggests: evolution-ssl | evolution to Suggests: evolution as
      evolution-ssl now Provides: evolution.
    * Removed the Suggests: guppi as the new version isn't packaged yet and
      packaging changes are expected.
  * [configure.in] Remove es_* from ALL_LINGUAS as their .po files are quite

  * Included Evolution-Composer.idl in our sources, and modified debian/rules, 
    configure.in, idl/Makefile.am to use the local copy. Removed build 
    dependencies on Evolution, as it is currently a problematic package to 
    build on some of our architectures, which prevents us from propagating 
    to testing.
  * Extended the motivation of --with(out) feature choices in debian/rules.
  * Do away with the separate call of configure by passing configure flags to
    autogen.sh .
  * Use "install -p" to preserve timestamps.

  * The latest libgnome-dev has been built against the latest liborbit-dev, so
    that liborbit's includes like orb/orbit.h are found again. Updated the
    build dependencies accordingly.
  * Replaced src/parser.y with the CVS version which was changed to deal with 
    the problem with saving large floats that Johann Spies noted. 
    Added build dependency on bison. (Closes: #115216)

  * Following upstream's request, added a Suggests: eog which gnumeric can use
    as a component to view images.
  * Tightened bonobo build dependency as per CVS changes ("to fix some 
    crashes in printing and fix some stale docs").
  * Enabled support for sending spreadsheets via Evolution, which seems to work
    fine. Added build dependency on evolution-ssl-dev or evolution-dev and a 
    matching Suggests:.
  * Replaced GNOME_Gnumeric.oaf.in with the CVS version which disables the
    "Embeddable Grid Component Factory" as well.
  * [debian/rules] Documented the reasons why we disable some features.

    * Permanently leave the GAL red queen's race by linking statically

  * [debian/control]
    * Tightened xml-i18n build requirements per README.
    * Loosened GAL requirements.
    * Depend on docbook-utils rather than cygnus-stylesheets which is a dummy

    * Rely on upstream's generated on-line help as we currently don't have
      a gnome-doc-tools package (see #100954) needed to deal with the
      "DTD DocBook PNG Variant V1.0" used for gnumeric's documentation.
    * Call autoheader.
    * Call automake "--add-missing".
    * We back to using 'configure.in' rather than 'configure.ac', so don't
      remove that file, but do clean out a lot of other generated files.
  * [debian/copyright] Refer to AUTHORS file for list of contributors.
  * Fixed some minor compilation problems; see the source's ChangeLog files.

    * Explicitly disabled Evolution support.
      It is not mentioned in NEWS or README, so presumably it is not yet ready
      for production use.
    * Removed the plugins' `.la' files: gnumeric's plugins are not public 
      libraries nor do they on libtool's libltdl, so policy does not require
      them to be included. (Closes: #62429)

    - [configure.in] Removed es_* from ALL_LINGUAS as their .po files are quite

    - [debian/rules] Explicitly disabled GDA for consistency across
