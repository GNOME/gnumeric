gnumeric (0.75-0.2) unstable; urgency=high

  * [debian/control]
    * If /etc/paper.config isn't available, previewing and printing fails. 
      Added a dependency on a recent enough gnome-libs-data known to include 
      that file to prevent these problems. (Closes: #117983)
    * Tightened the libgnomeprint-dev build dependency as older versions may
      segfault in their postinst, causing build failures with the build 
      daemons.
    * Temporarily added build dependency on libfreetype6-dev which is needed 
      for gnome-print but not yet declared by libgnomeprint-dev.
    * Changed Suggests: evolution-ssl | evolution to Suggests: evolution as
      evolution-ssl now Provides: evolution.
    * Removed the Suggests: guppi as the new version isn't packaged yet and
      packaging changes are expected.
  * [configure.in] Remove es_* from ALL_LINGUAS as their .po files are quite
    incomplete and out of date. (Closes: #119514)

gnumeric (0.72-0.2) unstable; urgency=high

  * Included Evolution-Composer.idl in our sources, and modified debian/rules, 
    configure.in, idl/Makefile.am to use the local copy. Removed build 
    dependencies on Evolution, as it is currently a problematic package to 
    build on some of our architectures, which prevents us from propagating 
    to testing.
  * Extended the motivation of --with(out) feature choices in debian/rules.
  * Do away with the separate call of configure by passing configure flags to
    autogen.sh .
  * Use "install -p" to preserve timestamps.

  * The build daemons always seem to pick the first of ORed build dependencies.
    Put evolution-dev before evolution-ssl-dev as it should be available to 
    all.
  * The latest libgnome-dev has been built against the latest liborbit-dev, so
    that liborbit's includes like orb/orbit.h are found again. Updated the
    build dependencies accordingly.
  * Replaced src/parser.y with the CVS version which was changed to deal with 
    the problem with saving large floats that Johann Spies noted. 
    Added build dependency on bison. (Closes: #115216)

  * Following upstream's request, added a Suggests: eog which gnumeric can use
    as a component to view images.
  * Tightened bonobo build dependency as per CVS changes ("to fix some 
    crashes in printing and fix some stale docs").
  * Enabled support for sending spreadsheets via Evolution, which seems to work
    fine. Added build dependency on evolution-ssl-dev or evolution-dev and a 
    matching Suggests:.
  * Replaced GNOME_Gnumeric.oaf.in with the CVS version which disables the
    "Embeddable Grid Component Factory" as well.
  * [debian/rules] Documented the reasons why we disable some features.
  * [configure.in] Documented why we link against GAL statically.

    * Loosened GAL requirements.
    * Depend on docbook-utils rather than cygnus-stylesheets which is a dummy
      package nowadays.
  * [debian/rules]
    * Rely on upstream's generated on-line help as we currently don't have
      a gnome-doc-tools package (see #100954) needed to deal with the
      "DTD DocBook PNG Variant V1.0" used for gnumeric's documentation.
    * Call autoheader.
    * Call automake "--add-missing".
    * We back to using 'configure.in' rather than 'configure.ac', so don't
      remove that file, but do clean out a lot of other generated files.
  * [debian/copyright] Refer to AUTHORS file for list of contributors.
  * Fixed some minor compilation problems; see the source's ChangeLog files.

gnumeric (0.68-0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload of new upstream release, after conferring with
    Vincent.
  * [debian/*] Redone based on current dh_make template.
  * Split documentation into a separate package. (Closes: #62430)
  * [debian/rules]
    * Explicitly disabled Evolution support.
      It is not mentioned in NEWS or README, so presumably it is not yet ready
      for production use.
    * Removed the plugins' `.la' files: gnumeric's plugins are not public 
      libraries nor do they on libtool's libltdl, so policy does not require
      them to be included. (Closes: #62429)
  * [debian/gnumeric.mime] Added text/comma-separated-values entry; corrected
    nametemplates which had .xls and .gnumeric swapped. (Closes: #101059).
  * [debian/gnumeric-man.sgml] Added a manpage. (Closes: #102047)
  * [debian/control]
    * Updated the description.
    * Added build dependency on docbook-to-man.
    * Added missing build dependency on flex. (Closes: #103776) 
    * Tightened the build dependency on libxml-dev. (Closes: #105344)
    * Updated Standards-Version.
  * [configure.in] Reinstated ja, ko, zh_CN.GB2312, zh_TW.Big5 as their po 
    files were updated and no longer cause problems.
  * Clean up bug reports that are no longer relevant:
    * We build with the latest available libgal. 
      (Closes: #99679, #103489, #104031, #105274)
    * The accidental deletion of HTML documentation was fixed in a previous
      upload. (Closes: #102270)
    * Backspace not working in cells was fixed upstream. (Closes: #106796)
    * Shrinking output in print setup was fixed upstream. (Closes: #55096)
    * Verified that CSV export works fine with this version. (Closes: #100111)
    * Non-ancient versions of Gnumeric have no problems with reading back
      their own file format. (Closes: #98779)

  * ACK bugs fixed by previous NMU:
    Closes: #94017, #96708, #80016, #51547, #70837, #96863, #96080, #87837.
    Closes: #96062, #96080, #96863.
  * Printing problems should be solved.
    Closes: #80869, #92986, #92849.
  * Integrated NMU work from JHM Dassen:
    - The problem of dsum freezing gnumeric when cells involved were deleted
      was fixed upstream. (Closes: #90875).
    - [configure.in] Removed es_* from ALL_LINGUAS as their .po files are quite
      out of date compared to plain es. (Closes: #89108).
    - [debian/rules] Explicitly disabled GDA for consistency across
      architectures; explicitly enabled warnings.
    - [debian/rules] Compile -D_GNU_SOURCE for various functions and macros,
      like caddr_t and M_PI_2.
    - [debian/control] Added build dependency on xml-i18n-tools; updated build
      dependencies on libgal, libxml1 and libole.

gnumeric (0.64-1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Documentation:
    * Ensure documentation is included. (Closes: #94017, #96708)
    * [debian/gnumeric.doc-base] New, so debhelper registers us with doc-base.
    * [debian/control] Added build dependency on cygnus-stylesheets as we 
      generate the documentation from its SGML source.
  * Menu support:
    * [debian/menu] Added menu hints. (Closes: #80016)
  * MIME support:
    * [debian/mime.gnumeric] Renamed to debian/gnumeric.mime so MIME handler
      registration through debhelper works. (Closes: #51547, #70837)
    * [debian/gnumeric.mime] Register as a handler for application/x-gnumeric 
      as well; added "nametemplate"s.
  * Localisation:
    * [debian/control] Added missing build dependency on gettext.
    * [po/da.po]: corrected charset to ISO 8859-1.
    * [configure.in] Removed ja, ko, zh_CN.GB2312, zh_TW.Big5 from ALL_LINGUAS
      as msgfmt on them fails (with errors like invalid multibyte sequence,
      end-of-line within string, invalid control sequence).
    * [debian/rules] Generate "configure".
    * [debian/control] Added build dependency on autoconf.
  * Other build and dependencies changes:
    * Compiled against current libgal
      (Closes: #96863, #96080)
    * [debian/control] Updated build dependency for libgal. 
    * [debian/control] Added missing build dependency on debhelper.
    * [debian/control] Downgrade dependency on gnome-help to Suggests as GNOME 
      allows configuration of a different help browser. (Closes: #87837).
    * [debian/control] Removed Recommends: python-dev as there's a Depends:
      for it already.
    * [debian/rules] Explicitly disable GB and Guile, so that builds on other 
      architectures will not accidentally get additional dependencies.
    * [debian/rules] Remove generated files po/messages, po/cat-id-tbl.c 
      as part of `clean'.
    * [debian/dirs] We don't need to create usr/X11R6/lib anymore.
