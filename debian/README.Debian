gnumeric for Debian: FAQs
-------------------------

Q: The "help" function does not work. Is gnumeric broken?
A: Probably not. If you've got a warning like
	Bonobo-WARNING **: Could not open help topics file NULL for app gnumeric
   the GNOME help system could not find the gnumeric manual. Install the
   "gnumeric-doc" package which contains the gnumeric manual.

Q: The graph guru does not work. Is gnumeric broken?
A: Probably not. Gnumeric relies on an external component for graphing to work.
   If you want to use graphing in gnumeric, make sure you have installed a 
   package that provides the "guppi-gnumeric" package (do 
   "apt-cache showpkg guppi-gnumeric" to find one).

Q: How do I insert an image into a worksheet?
A: Make sure you have the "eog" package installed, and use Insert -> Object.

Q: Why doesn't "File -> Send" work?
A: Gnumeric relies on an external component for mailing workbooks. Install
   the "evolution" package.

Q: Where is the <foo> plugin?
A: Plugins that require additional libraries or programs are packaged 
   separately (e.g. "gnumeric-python"). Do "apt-cache search gnumeric" to
   find them.
