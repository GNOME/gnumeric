Description: GNOME SpreadSheet
 The goal of this spreadsheet is to become as powerful as other
 spreadsheets on the market and do this cleanly and smartly.  We have
 to do this while being as compatible as possible with Excel.
 .
 If you are familiar with Excel, you should be ready to use
 Gnumeric.  We have tried to clone all of the good features and stay as
 compatible as possible with Excel in terms of usability.  
 .
 Gnumeric is still a young program and it is advancing steadily.  If
 you are interested in contributing to the development of Gnumeric, you
 probably will want to read the doc/Design file.
