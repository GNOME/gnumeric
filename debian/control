Description: A GNOME1 spreadsheet application
 Gnumeric is a powerful spreadsheet application that interoperates well
 with other spreadsheets. It comes with plugins that enable it to deal with
 commonly used spreadsheet file formats, including
  o Microsoft(R) Excel95 (.xls)
  o Comma/Character Separated Values (.csv)
  o XBase (.dbf), 
  o MultiPlan (.sylk)
  o PlanPerfect
  o Lotus 123 (.wks, .wk1)
  o Applix version 4 (.as)
  o Data Interchange Format (.dif)
  o GNU Oleo (.oleo)
  o SC/XSpread
  o Linear and integer program expression format (.mps)
 and can export to LaTeX, Roff and HTML as well.
 .
 Gnumeric should be easy to use, in particular if you are familiar with
 Excel.
 .
 Gnumeric is a GNOME application. GNOME (GNU Network Object Model Environment) 
 is a user-friendly set of applications and desktop tools to be used in 
 conjunction with a window manager for the X Window System.
 .
 This particular package contains the current stable release of Gnumeric
 which uses the GNOME1 libraries. The "gnumeric" package contains the
 current development release which uses the GNOME2 libraries and contains
 many improvements but lacks graphing functionality. If you don't require
 graphing functionality, use the "gnumeric" package rather than this one.
