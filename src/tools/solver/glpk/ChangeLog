Fri Nov 14 12:00:00 2003 Andrew Makhorin <mao@mai2.rcnet.ru>

        * GLPK 4.2 has been released.

        * glpiet.h, glpiet.c, glpios.h, glpios1.c, glpios2.c, glpios3.c
        A preliminary implementation of the Integer Optimization Suite
        (IOS) was included in the package. Eventually IOS will replace
        the Implicit Enumeration Suite (IES).

        * glplpx.h, glplpx6d.c
        A dummy version of the integer optimization routine lpx_intopt
        was included in the package. Later this routine will replace the
        routine lpx_integer.

        * examples/glpsol.c
        A new command-line option --int-opt was added to the solver to
        call lpx_intopt rather than lpx_integer.

        * glpbcs.h, glpbcs1.c, glpbcs2.c
        Being replaced by IOS routines (see above) the Branch-and-Cut
        Framework (BCS) routines were removed from the package.

        * examples/tspsol.c
        Stand-alone Symmetric TSP solver was completely re-programmed
        using IOS routines.

        * glplib.h, glplib2.c, glplib4.c
        The random-number generator was implemented. It is based on the
        module GB_FLIB from the Stanford GraphBase originally developed
        by Donald Knuth.

        * glphbsm.c, glplpx8a.c, glpmps.c
        All calls to fopen/fclose were replaced by corresponding calls
        to ufopen/ufclose due to bug reports provided by Morten Welinder
        <terra@gnu.org> and <jpark@sfwmd.gov>.

        * glpmps.c
        The code was made re-entrant.

        * glplpx8b.c
        API routine lpx_print_sens_bnds for bounds sensitivity analysis
        contributed by Brady Hunsaker <hunsaker@engr.pitt.edu> was added
        to the package. This feature is also available in glpsol via the
        command-line option --bounds.

        * contrib/jni/*.*
        New version of GLPK JNI (Java Native Interface) contributed by
        Chris Rosebrugh <cpr@pobox.com> was added to the package.

        * contrib/deli/*.*
        GLPK DELI (Delphi Interface) contributed by Ivo van Baren
        <i.van.baren@freeler.nl> was added to the package.

        * glplpx3.c
        Default method to scale the problem was changed to equilibration
        scaling (lp->scale = 1 in lpx_reset_parms).

        * glplpx6a.c
        Two minor (non-critical) typos were fixed due to report provided
        by Andrew Hamilton-Wright <andrewhw@ieee.org>.

        * glplpp2.c
        An untested case (line 941) had been tested due to bug report
        provided by Jiri Spitz <jiri.spitz@telecom.cz>.

        * w32bc5.mak, w32vc6.mak, w32vc6d.mak, d32dmc.mak
        Several makefiles were added to allow building GLPK library for
        some non-GNU 32-bit platforms.

Sat Aug 23 12:00:00 2003 Andrew Makhorin <mao@mai2.rcnet.ru>

        * GLPK 4.1 has been released.

        * glpmpl1.c, glpmpl3.c
        Some bugs were fixed in the MathProg translator due to the bug
        reports provided by Giles Thompson <gwpt1@cus.cam.ac.uk>:
        conditional set expressions were incorrectly parsed;
        dimen attribute was not set by default when a set was used
        recursively in its own declaration;
        logical expressions ... in if ... then ... else ... did not
        work;
        displaying set expressions did not free memory allocated for
        temporary results.

        * glpmpl3.c (reduce_terms)
        Implementation of summation of linear forms over domain was
        improved to reduce complexity of that operation from O(n*n) to
        O(n*log n). The improvement was made due to a report provided
        by Sebastien de Menten <sdementen@hotmail.com>.

        * glplpx6a.c (line 1056), glpmip1.c (line 641)
        Two minor bugs were fixed due to the bug report provided by
        Kendall Demaree <kendal.demaree@verizon.net>.

        * glplpx.h, glplpx6a.c
        The method of one artificial variable implemented in the routine
        lpx_prim_art and used on the phase I in the glpk simplex solver
        has a serious defect: for some lp instances it erroneously
        reports that the problem has no primal feasible solution. This
        error appears when the column of the artificial variable, which
        enters the basis to make it primal feasible, has large
        constraint coefficients, that leads to small reduced costs of
        non-basic variables and premature termination of the search,
        i.e. to wrong conclusion that the problem has no primal feasible
        solution. To avoid this defect the routine lpx_prim_feas was
        included. It implements the method of implicit artifical
        variables (based on minimization of the sum of infeasibilities),
        which is a bit slower but much more robust. The routine
        lpx_prim_feas having the same functionality now is used instead
        the routine lpx_prim_art.

        * glpinv.h, glpinv.c
        The test used in the routine inv_update to detect low accuracy
        after updating LU-factorization of the basis matrix was replaced
        by a new, more robust test.

        * glplpx6c.c
        Selecting an active node to be solved next in the routine
        btrack_bestp was changed. Now, if any integer feasible solution
        has not been found yet, the routine chooses an active node which
        has the minimal sum of integer infeasibilities.

        * glpmip.h, glpmip1.c
        The additional flag int_obj was included in the structure
        MIPTREE used by the branch-and-bound. This flag is set in the
        routine mip_create_tree and used in the routine is_better. It
        means that the objective is integral, i.e. depends only on
        integer variables with integer objective coefficients. The test
        used in the routine check_integrality was also replaced by a
        new, more reasonable one.

        * glplpx1.c
        A minor bug was fixed in the routine lpx_check_name.

        * glpmpl.h, glpmpl4.c, glplpx8d.c
        The flag skip_data was added to the parameter list of the
        routine mpl_read_model. If this flag is set, the data section
        in the model file is ignored. Corresponding change was made in
        the routine lpx_read_model. Now, if both model and data files
        are specified, the data section in the model file is ignored.

        * glplpx8c.c
        A minor bug (wrong format used for writing free columns) in the
        routine lpx_write_lpt was fixed due to the bug report provided
        by Bernhard Schmidt <schmidt@math.uni-augsburg.de>

        * sample/glpsol.c
        The command-line parameter --tmlim, which allows limiting the
        solution time, was added.

        * doc/lang.*, doc/refman.*
        New edition of the GLPK documentation was included.

        * java-binding/*.*
        New version of the GLPK JNI (Java Native Interface) package was
        included in the distribution.

        * sample/lpglpk40.c
        A non-trivial example was added. It allows using GLPK as a base
        LP solver for Concorde, a program for solving Traveling Salesman
        Problem (TSP). For details see comments in lpglpk40.c.

        * sample/*.mod
        Some examples of LP and MIP models written in GNU MathProg were
        added.

Tue May 06 12:00:00 2003 Andrew Makhorin <mao@mai2.rcnet.ru>

        * GLPK 4.0 has been released.

        * glpmpl.h, glpmpl1.c, glpmpl2.c, glpmpl3.c, glpmpl4.c
        The model translator for the GNU MathProg modeling language was
        implemented and included in the package.

        * glplpx.h, glplpx8d.c
        The api routine lpx_read_model, which is an interface to the
        MathProg translator, was included in the package.

        * glplpx.h, glplpx8a.c
        The api routine lpx_print_prob for writing LP/MIP problem data
        in plain text format was included in the package.

        * sample/glpsol.c
        New version of the GLPK stand-alone LP/MIP solver that supports
        the GNU MathProg modeling language was implemented.

        * doc/lang.latex, doc/lang.dvi, doc/lang.ps
        The document "GLPK: Modeling Language GNU MathProg" was included
        in the package.

        * doc/refman.latex, doc/refman.dvi, doc/refman.ps
        New edition of the GLPK Reference Manual was included in the
        package.

        * glplpx8c.c
        A bug in the api routine lpx_write_lpt was fixed. Due to that
        bug an addressing error occured in the routine if the objective
        function has the non-zero constant term.

        * glplan.h, glplan1.c, glplan2.c, glplan3.c, glplan4.c,
        * glplan5.c, glplan6.c, glplan7.c, glplan8.c, glplpx8b.c
        All modules of the translator for the GLPK/L modeling language
        were removed from the package, because GLPK/L being completely
        superseded by GNU MathProg is no more supported.

Tue Mar 25 12:00:00 2003 Andrew Makhorin <mao@mai2.rcnet.ru>

        * GLPK 3.3 has been released.

        * glplpp.h, glplpp1.c, glplpp2.c
        An implementation of the built-in LP presolver was added to the
        package.

        * glplpx.h
        The flag presol was added to the structure LPX. This flag tells
        the lpx_simplex whether the built-in LP presolver should be used
        or not. By default this flag is off. Also three macros (namely
        LPX_E_NOPFS, LPX_E_NODFS, and LPX_K_PRESOL) that concern using
        the LP presolver were introduced.

        * glplpx3.c, glplpx6a.c
        These modules was changed to use the built-in LP presolver.

        * sample/glpsol.c
        Command line options --presol and --nopresol that concern using
        the LP presolver were added to the stand-alone LP/MIP solver.

        * glplan1.c
        This module was changed to allow declaring sets like A[1:10] in
        the models written in the GLPK/L modeling language.

        * doc/refman.latex, doc/lang.latex
        New editions of the documents "GLPK User's Guide" and "GLPK/L
        Modeling Language" were included in the distribution.

        * java-binding/*.*
        The package GLPK JNI (Java Native Interface) implementing Java
        binding for GLPK was included in the distribution. This package
        was developed and programmed by Yuri Victorovich <yuri@gjt.org>.

Tue Feb 18 12:00:00 2003 Andrew Makhorin <mao@mai2.rcnet.ru>

        * GLPK 3.2.4 has been released.

        * glplpx6b.c
        The code was changed to allow auxiliary variables have non-zero
        objective coefficients.

        Also a minor bug was fixed (the constant term was not considered
        on displaying the objective function value).

        * sample/glpsol.c
        The code was changed to fix a bug (the command-line option 'bfs'
        was not recognized). The bug was fixed due to report provided by
        Olivier <odwl@skynet.be>.

        * glplpt.c
        The code was changed to fix a bug (binary variables were treated
        erroneously as integer ones).

        * glplpx6b.c
        The code was changed to fix a bug (variables that have no lower
        bounds were incorrectly processed on converting to the standard
        formulation). The bug was fixed due to report kindly provided by
        Kjell Eikland <kjell.eikland@broadpark.no>.

Mon Nov 11 12:00:00 2002 Andrew Makhorin <mao@mai2.rcnet.ru>

        * GLPK 3.2.3 has been released.

        * glpmip.h, glpmip1.c
        A preliminary implementation of the branch-and-bound driver
        based on the implicit enumeration suite (glpies) was added to
        the package. This module is not documented yet.

        * glplpx6c.c
        A new implementation of the api routine lpx_integer which now
        is based on the b&b driver (see glpmip above) was included in
        the package. This new implementation has exactly the same
        functionality as the old version and therefore all changes are
        transparent to the api user.

        * glpbbm.h, glpbbm.c
        * glprsm.h, glprsm1.c, glprsm2.c
        * glplp.h, glplp.c
        These modules were removed from the package, because they were
        used only in the old version of the routine lpx_integer, which
        was replaced by the new version (see glplpx6c above).

        * glplpx.h, glplpx6a.c
        The api routine lpx_check_kkt was included in the package and
        its description was added in the reference manual. This routine
        allows checking Karush-Kuhn-Tucker optimality conditions for an
        LP solution.

        * glplpx.h, glplpx8a.c
        Now the api routine lpx_print_sol also prints information about
        "solution quality" obtained via the api routine lpx_check_kkt.

        * glplpx.h, glplpx8a.c
        New api routines lpx_read_bas and lpx_write_bas were included
        in the package and documented. The routine lpx_write_bas allows
        writing a current basis from an LP object to a text file in the
        MPS format. The routine lpx_read_bas allows reading a basis
        prepared in the MPS format from a text file into an LP object.

        * glplpt.c
        The parsing routine which reads LP problem data prepared in the
        CPLEX LP format was modified to allow specifying lower bounds
        of variables also in the form 'variable >= lower bound' (in the
        bounds section). This modification was made due to a notice
        provided by Ivan Luzzi <iluzzi@libero.it>.

        * glplpx.h, glplpx8c.c
        The api routine lpx_write_lpt which allows writing LP problem
        data from an LP object to a text file using the CPLEX LP format
        was included in the package and documented.

        * glplpx.h, glplpx3.c
        The control parameter LPX_K_LPTORIG that affects the behavior
        of the api routine lpx_write_lpt was introduced.

        * glplan6.c
        The semantics of the language GLPK/L was changed to allow
        selection in case when not all mute letters of a predicate (the
        operand that follows the keyword 'where') are presented in a
        parameter (the operand that precedes the keyword 'where'), i.e.
        to allow writing something like this:
            y[j] := sum(i, x[i] where p[i,j]);
        The paragraph "Selection" in the langauge description (page 25)
        was also correspondingly changed. This change of the language
        semantics was undertaken due to a notice provided by Peter Lee
        <plee@kinggee.com.au>.

        * sample/hwd.lpm
        A nice example of LP model written in GLPK/L and contributed by
        Peter Lee <plee@kinggee.com.au> was included in the package.

        * glplpx6b.c
        The api routine lpx_interior was modified: a) to compute dual
        values for all structural as well as auxiliary variables; b) to
        allow specifying non-zero objective coefficients at auxiliary
        variables.

        * sample/glpsol.c
        Three new command-line options were added to the solver, which
        are: --plain, --orig, and --wrlpt.

Mon Oct 14 12:00:00 2002 Andrew Makhorin <mao@mai2.rcnet.ru>

        * GLPK 3.2.2 has been released.

        * glplpt.h, glplpt.c
        A module that reads LP/MIP problem data in CPLEX LP format was
        implemented.

        * glplpx8c.c
        An api routine lpx_read_lpt that reads LP/MIP problem data in
        CPLEX LP format was implemented.

        * sample/glpsol.c, sample/plan.lpt
        A new command-line option '--lpt' that allows reading LP/MIP
        problem data in CPLEX LP format was added to the solver.

        * doc/refman.latex, doc/refman.dvi, doc/refman.ps
        A new edition of the Reference Manual was included.

        * source/*.c
        Casting to (unsigned char) was added in some calls to the
        classification functions (isalpha, etc.). The bug was fixed due
        to report provided by Morten Welinder <terra@diku.dk>.

        * glplpx8a.c
        The local routine mps_numb used in the routine lpx_write_mps
        was modified to correctly format floating-point numbers that
        have two digits in the decimal exponent. The bug was fixed due
        to report provided by Vlahos Kiriakos <Kiriakos.Vlahos@gs.com>.

        * glplan.h, glplan1.c, ..., glplan8.c
        Several serious bugs were fixed in the language processor due
        to reports provided by <NORBERT.PIOTROWSKI@LHSYSTEMS.COM>:
        (a) a static search tree used to find sparse array elements was
        sometimes overwritten that caused the message 'assertion failed'
        to appear; the bug was fixed by creating separate search trees
        in parsing routines; (b) a variable declared using the
        predicate-controlled variable declaration statement had wrong
        order of domain sets, because the variable array was built as
        a copy of the predicate array; the bug was fixed by using the
        internal routine transpose that coordinates mute letters (and
        therefore domain sets) on copying sparse arrays; (c) sometimes
        assignment statements like x[#a,#b,#c] := ... was incorrectly
        processed; the bug was fixed by including an appropriate check
        into the internal routine assign_stmt.

        * glp_simplex.c
        An additional check to see if all lower bounds are not greater
        than corresponding upper bounds was included in the routine to
        prevent wrong results to appear. Such incorrectness sometimes
        was not detected, namely, when variables with such bounds were
        non-basic and never entered the basis.

        * glpspx1.c
        Maximal number of simplex iterations before reinversion was
        decreased from 100 to 50. This allowed to improve accuracy and,
        that is more important, to reduce the solution time for many
        serial lp problems approximately 1.5--2 times.

        * glpspx2.c
        A check to see if all elements in the column chosen to enter
        the basis are close to zero in the routine spx_prim_chuzr was
        temporarily removed because this check gave wrong conclusion in
        case when the corresponding non-basic variable had zero column
        in the constraint matrix. An analogous check to see if all
        elements in the row chosen to leave the basis are close to zero
        in the routine spx_dual_chuzc was also temporarily removed on
        the same reason. The bug was fixed due to reports provided by
        Flavio Keidi Miyazawa <fkm@ic.unicamp.br> and Vlahos Kiriakos
        <Kiriakos.Vlahos@gs.com>.

Mon Aug 12 12:00:00 2002 Andrew Makhorin <mao@mai2.rcnet.ru>

        The following new api routines were added: lpx_eval_activity,
        lpx_eval_red_cost, lpx_reduce_form, lpx_mixed_gomory.

        * glptsp.h, glptsp.c
        A module for reading TSP data using TSPLIB format was included
        in the package.

Mon Jul 15 12:00:00 2002 Andrew Makhorin <mao@mai2.rcnet.ru>

        * GLPK 3.2 has been released.

        * glplpx.h, glplpx1.c, glplpx2.c
        The identifier 'class' (used as a member name in the structure
        LPX and as an argument name in the routine lpx_set_class) was
        changed to 'clss' in order to avoid conflicts with C++ reserved
        words.

        * glpk.h, glplpx.h, glplpx1.c, glplpx2.c, glplpx6a.c,
        * glplpx6b.c, glplpx6c.c, glplpx7.c, glplpx8.c

        the distribution.

        * glpapi.h, glpapi1.c, glpapi2.c, glpapi3.c, glpapi4.c
        These files (which contain old api routines) were removed from
        the package.

        * glpipm1.c, glpipm2.c
        The file glpipm1.c was renamed to glpipm.c. The file glpipm2.c

        * glpapi7.c
        These modules were replaced by a new implementation of the
        simplex method and therefore they were removed from the package
        (however they still can be found in the subdirectory 'oldsrc').

        * glprsm1.c
        The routine crash_aa was replaced by a new implementation and
        therefore it was removed from the file 'glprsm1.c'.

        * glplpx.h, glplpx.c, glpspx.h, glpspx1.c, glpspx2.c, glpspx3.c,

        * glppfi.h, glppfi.c, glprfi.h, glprfi.c
        These routines implement some other forms of the basis matrix.
        Now they became obsolete being functionally superseded by the
        new version of basis maintenance routines (see above) and were
        removed from the package (however they still can be found in the
        subdirectory 'oldsrc').

        * glpbbm.c, glprsm.h, glprsm1.h, glprsm2.h, glpspx.h, glpspx2.c,
        * glprsm2.c, glpsol.c

Mon Dec 10 12:00:00 2001 Andrew Makhorin <mao@mai2.rcnet.ru>

        * GLPK 3.0.4 has been released.

        * glpspx.h, glpspx1.c, glpspx2.c, glpapi/glp_simplex2.h
        A new, more efficient version of the two-phase primal simplex
        method was implemented (advanced initial basis, projected
        steepest edge, recursive computations of solution components).

        * glpapi/glp_call_bbm1.c
        Now LP relaxation can be solved either using rsm1_driver(), or
        using glp_simplex2(). The choice is controlled by the parameter
        'meth' (a member of struct bbm1).

        * sample/glpsol.c
        The new implementation of the simplex method is now used by
        default. The old version is available via --old-sim option.

        * glpmat/gm_scaling.c
        Now this routine displays only two lines: an initial "quality"
        and a final "quality".

        * glplp/prepro_lp.c
        Identifiers 'fmin' and 'fmax' renamed to 'f_min' and 'f_max' in
        order to avoid conflict with <math.h>. The bug was fixed due to
        report provided by Sami Farin <sfarin@ratol.fi>.

Wed Oct 03 12:00:00 2001 Andrew Makhorin <mao@mai2.rcnet.ru>

        * GLPK 3.0.3 has been released.

        * glprsm/harris_row.c, glprsm/harris_col.c
        The relative tolerance used on the first pass of the two-pass
        ratio test was replaced by the absolute tolerance.

        * glprsm/rsm_primal.c, glprsm/rsm_feas.c, glprsm/rsm_dual.c
        The absolute tolerance passed to the two-pass ratio test routine
        was decaresed (for both primal and dual simplex).

        These changes were made in order to improve numerical stability
        of the simplex method.

        * glprsm/glp_call_rsm1.c, glprsm/glp_call_bbm1.c,
        * glprsm/glp_simplex1, glprsm/glp_pivoting.c

        * GLPK 3.0.2 has been released.

        * glpfhv.h, glpfhv.c
        New version of the basis maintaining routines was implemented.
        These routines, which are based on so called FHV-factorization
        (a variety of LU-factorization) and Gustavson's data structures,
        perform the main operations on the basis matrix faster at the
        expense of some worsening numerical accuracy.

        * glprsm.h, glprsm/afi.c
        The routines, which implement AFI (Advanced Form of the
        Inverse) based on FHV-factorization, were added to the package.
        This new form is available via the parameter form = 3 (on API
        level) or via the option --afi (in GLPSOL solver).

        * EFI was renamed to PFI
        In order to correct terminology the acronym EFI (Elimination
        Form of the Inverse) was replaced by PFI (Product Form of the
        Inverse) everywhere in the source code and the documentation.

        * glpset/umalloc.c, glpset/ucalloc.c
        * glpset/get_atom.c, glpset/get_atomv.c
        These memory management routines were changed in order *not* to
        clear allocated memory blocks by binary zeros.

Wed Aug 01 12:00:00 2001 Andrew Makhorin <mao@mai2.rcnet.ru>

        * GLPK 3.0.1 has been released.

        the package in more complex algorithmic schemes.

        * glpapi/old_api.c
        All routines related to old API were gathered in one file named
        'old_api.c'.

        * glpapi/*.c
        These routines that implement new API were added to the package.

        * include/glpk.h, include/glpapi.h
        Specifications of new API routines and data structures were
        added to these headers. Specifications of old API routines and
        data structures were locked by #ifdef GLP_OLD_API directive.

        * doc/guide.texinfo
        New edition of the document "GLPK User's Guide" that correspond
        to new API was included.

        In particular, heuristic routines were carried out from the main
        driver routine.

        Additional GLPK API routines were documented.

        New edition of the document "GLPK User's Guide" was included in
        the package.

        The preliminary document "Mixed Integer Programming Using GLPK
        Version 2.2 (Supplement to GLPK User's Guide)" was removed from
        the package, because this material was included in GLPK User's
        Guide.

Thu Mar 15 12:00:00 2001 Andrew Makhorin <mao@mai2.rcnet.ru>

        * GLPK 2.2 has been released.

        Now GLPK includes a tentative implementation of the
        branch-and-bound procedure based on the dual simplex method for
        mixed integer linear programming (MIP).

        The preliminary document "Mixed Integer Programming Using GLPK
        Version 2.2 (Supplement to GLPK User's Guide)" was included into
        the package in plain text format (see the file 'mip.txt' in the
        subdirectory 'doc' of the distribution).

        * glpmip.h, glpmip/*.c, glpapi/glp_integer.c
        These routines (that implement the branch-and-bound method) were
        added to the package.

        * glprsm/rsm1_driver.c
        These routines (which are drivers to basic components of the
        revised simplex method) were added to the package.

Mon Feb 19 12:00:00 2001 Andrew Makhorin <mao@mai2.rcnet.ru>

        * GLPK 2.1 has been released.

        * glprsm.h, glprsm/*.c

        was included into the package.

Thu Jan 25 12:00:00 2001 Andrew Makhorin <mao@mai2.rcnet.ru>

        * GLPK 2.0 has been released.

        Now GLPK includes a tentative implementation of the primal-dual
        interior point method for large-scale linear programming (for
        more details see the file `NEWS' in the distribution). A number
        of routines related to the interior point method were added to
        the package.

        * insist.c
        The routine `insist' and the macro of the same name were
        introduced into the package in order to replace the standard
        macro `assert'. Some routines require the expression specified
        in the `assert' macro to be evaluated, but compiling the package
        with NDEBUG option prevents from that. This bug was fixed due to
        bug report provided by Peter A. Huegler <phuegler@bsco.com>.

        * Makefile.in
        Minor bug was fixed due to a patch provided by Alexandre Oliva
        <oliva@lsd.ic.unicamp.br>.
