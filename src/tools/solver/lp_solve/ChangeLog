2002-03-04 Jukka-Pekka Iivonen <jiivonen@hutcs.cs.hut.fi>

	* Initial import of the lp-solve-3.2 package.  Lot's of changes
	related to Glib and GNOME coding style.

2002-03-04 Original ChangeLog of the lp-solve 3.2
	
	Changed after first review for comp.sources.reviewed:

	- Bug with row singletons and assignment fixed.
	- Makefile fixed.
	- Formatted man page (lp_solve.man) added + target to generate it
	  in the Makefile
	- install signal handler after reading the input to avoid dumping core
	- changed names of some examples to make them uniform
	- added correct results for all examples

	Changes since the comp.sources.reviewed release:

	- added more input sanity checking
	- removed a bug in the Branch-and-Bound code which could cause
	  umlimited recursion and finally a core dump
	- removed the duplicate declaration of global variable Rows
	- replaced bcopy by the ANSI standard memcopy
	- various small cosmetic changes

	Changes for version 1.1

	- added KNOWN_BUGS file.
	- accept x <= 0 as a sane bound.

	Changes for version 1.2

	- added (unsupported by me) VMS_SUPPORT file
	- made lp_solve print the reason a problem cannot be solved
	  (unbounded or infeasible)
	- added input format extension to optionally indicate whether the
	  objective function should be minimized or maximized.
	- Added output(!) in real MPS format for the -v option.

	Changes for version 1.3

	- Added #ifdefs to handle the different definitions necessary for
	  yytext on different computers. Why is there no standard???
	- Fixed a very nasty bug in the parser which would handle variables
	  on the right hand side of the relational operator which had an
	  effective negative sign wrongly (actually, the negative sign was
	  ignored).
	- added -p option to print the values of the dual variables.
	- Added test target in Makefile to allow automatic testing with the
	  standard examples ex[1-5].lp.
	- Added syntax extension for optional user specified constraint
	  (dual) names.
	- Fixed bug in the combination of minimization of the objective
	  function (min: <obj fun>) and MILP problems. Pure LP worked ok.
	- From now on lp_solve refuses problems with just bounds (0 real
	  constraints). This does not work anyway.

	Changes for version 1.4

	- Various cosmetic changes to the sources
	- Added ex6.lp just for fun (read it!).
	- Added results obtained on netlib and miplib benchmark sets (thanks to
	  mps2eq).
	- removed pragmas for Alliant computers (they're out of business
	  anyway).
	- changed the default "double" type to REAL, which can be changed
	  during compilation (-DREAL=float or -DREAL='long double')

	Changes for version 1.5

	- Added -scale option for global scaling of the problem.
	- Fixed problem with Endetacol being written out of bounds.
	- Added -autoscale option for automatic scaling of rows and columns.
	- Added ex7.lp, an example which can only be solved when scaled
	  properly.
	- Added -solve_dual option to let lp_solve solve the dual of the
	  problem it is reading. This is not a very useful option, but I
	  needed it to check the results generated by the updated -p option
	  (see next item). It will not work with equality constraints.
	- The -p option now produces real dual values, thanks to a code hint by
	  Jeroen Dirks (jeroend@tor.numetrix.com)
	- The MILP branch-and-bound loop was rearranged by Jeroen Dirks
	  resulting in significantly increased performance (2 - 10 times
	  faster).

	Changes for 2.0a

	- Added a procedural interface (the lp toolkit).
	- removed -scale and -solve_dual options
	- renamed option -autoscale to -s

	Changes for 2.0b1	

	- Added -mps option to read MPS files. And also included some mps
	  associated functions in the toolkit.

	Changes for 2.0b2

	- Fixed bug in:
	  delete_lp
	  del_constraint
	  write_MPS
	- added:
	  write_LP
	  msp2lp
	  lp2mps

	Changes for 2.0b3

	- Changed default integer/noninteger value to 1e-3
	- Added Epsb in Iteration function at minit detection
	  (lp_solve gave infeasible for some feasible problems)
	- Added -degen perturbation option for degenerate problems.

	Changes for 2.0

	- Removed "Parsing" message
	- Made CHECK Warning output print to stderr

	Changes for 2.1beta

	- added '-time' option to print CPU times of parsing and optimization
	- fixed some MPS reading problems
	- allow empty OF in lp_solve format to get just a feasible solution
	- added filtering of very small pivots to improve numerical stability
	- fixed several bugs in lpkit.c and readmps.c

	Changes for 2.1

	- improved the speed of the MPS reader (considerably!) by
	  introducing hash tables
	  - fixed bug in column_in_lp
	  - updated Jeroen Dirks' email address in the sources
	  - added HARTMUT_DOCUMENTATION to the distribution

	Changes for 2.2

	- fixed memory leak in delete_lp
	- fixed some more lpkit.c bugs
	- got rid of the ugly global variables used in solve.c. 

	Changes for 2.3

	- fixed memory problem in solve.c (eta arrays were not always
	  realloc-ed on time).
	- support for RANGES in MPS reworked; should now be according to
	  standard
	- option -degen could sometimes produce "results" for infeasible
	  problems, fixed.
	- previous versions of lp_solve would not scale any column when integer
	  variables were present. Now only the actual integer columns are not
	  scaled.
	- copy_lp now also copies the rowname and colname hash tables

	Changes for 3.0

	- lp_solve now has an official open source license, 3.0 and up will
	  have the LGPL license attached.
	- there was a problem in write_MPS, where numbers were printed with
	  up to 16 digits instead of the maximum of 12

	Changes for 3.0

	- Bug fix with -degen option (constants were not so constant any more)

	Changes for 3.1

	- copy name strings in copy_hash_table to avoid crashes when old
	  lp's are freed
	- added call to btran at line 925 of solve.c according to an analysis
	  by Joerg Herbers

	Changes for 3.1a

	- fixed memory management problem in read.c introduced in 3.1

	Changes for 3.2

	- fixed eta realloc problem in solve.c
