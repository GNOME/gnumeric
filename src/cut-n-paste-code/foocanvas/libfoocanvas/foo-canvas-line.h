/* Line item for the canvas.  This is a polyline with configurable width, cap/join styles, and arrowheads.
 * If arrowheads are enabled, then three values are used to specify their shape:
 *
 *	arrow_shape_a:  Distance from tip of arrowhead to the center point.
 *	arrow_shape_b:  Distance from tip of arrowhead to trailing point, measured along the shaft.
 *	arrow_shape_c:	Distance of trailing point from outside edge of shaft.
 *
 * The following object arguments are available:
 *
 * name			type			read/write	description
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * points		FooCanvasPoints*	RW		Pointer to a FooCanvasPoints structure.
 *								This can be created by a call to
 *								foo_canvas_points_new() (in foo-canvas-util.h).
 *								X coordinates are in the even indices of the
 *								points->coords array, Y coordinates are in
 *								the odd indices.
 * fill_color		string			W		X color specification for line
 * fill_color_gdk	GdkColor*		RW		Pointer to an allocated GdkColor
 * fill_stipple		GdkBitmap*		RW		Stipple pattern for the line
 * width_pixels		uint			R		Width of the line in pixels.  The line width
 *								will not be scaled when the canvas zoom factor changes.
 * width_units		double			R		Width of the line in canvas units.  The line width
 *								will be scaled when the canvas zoom factor changes.
 * cap_style		GdkCapStyle		RW		Cap ("endpoint") style for the line.
 * join_style		GdkJoinStyle		RW		Join ("vertex") style for the line.
 * line_style		GdkLineStyle		RW		Line dash style
 * first_arrowhead	boolean			RW		Specifies whether to draw an arrowhead on the
 *								first point of the line.
 * last_arrowhead	boolean			RW		Specifies whether to draw an arrowhead on the
 *								last point of the line.
 * smooth		boolean			RW		Specifies whether to smooth the line using
 *								parabolic splines.
 * spline_steps		uint			RW		Specifies the number of steps to use when rendering curves.
 * arrow_shape_a	double			RW		First arrow shape specifier.
 * arrow_shape_b	double			RW		Second arrow shape specifier.
 * arrow_shape_c	double			RW		Third arrow shape specifier.
