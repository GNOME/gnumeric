This file is meant to hold a list of small tasks that need doing that would be
appropriate for new developers.

Description                                             Difficulty  Integration
------------------------------------------------------  ----------  -----------

- Financial functions (src/functions/fn-financial.c)    Medium      Very low

  from the toolbar for background or font.

  missing or do not conform to the style guides, 

- Add dynamic tooltips to the toolbar combo boxes	Medium	    Low
  eg when mousing over the colour combo toolbar
     we should be told what colour is selected.

- gtk-combo-text : A prettier mouse over for the	Medium	    Low
  text entry would be nice.

Difficulty: an estimate of how hard the task would be for the average hacker.
  (This is not an estimate of project size; a project can be very big, but
   easy at the same time.)

Integration: an estimate of how much of Gnumeric's internals you need to know
  in order to take on this project
