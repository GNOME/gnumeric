Gnumeric plugins typically either define a file format (input and/or output)
or a set of functions.  Nothing prevents a mixture -- that is just how things
have turned out so far.

When you add or delete files, don't forget...

* Edit po/POTFILES.in
* Edit configure.ac
* Edit plugins/Makefile.am






File-format plugins
--------------------

For a good skeleton, grab a copy of the applix plugin.



Plugins containing functions
-----------------------------

For a good skeleton, grab a copy of the fn-date plugin.
