The Excel code is not actually a plugin, despite its position in the
plugins directory. This is for ease of debugging at least initialy.

Simply select an excel file and watch those bits go flying.

For information on the Excel file format simply see:

	http://www.microsoft.com/msdn

OR mail me, ( you don't want to use that 'J++' applet ).

The 'ole' helper program is designed to let you inspect the contents of
OLE2 files. It has a complicated syntax, as described in the help you get
when you just run it.

Try for starters:

	./ole somefile.xls biff workbook

You _must_ be in the plugins/excel directory for it to find the biff_types.h
which it uses to annotate the biff records nicely; patches welcome.

It will also dump the contents of drawing streams inside the BIFF do:

	./ole somefile.xls draw workbook

Or to put / get files to / from an OLE file use:

	./ole somefile.xls put <filename> <stream name>
or
	./ole somefile.xls get <stream name> <filename>
