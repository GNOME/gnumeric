	What is XP?
			A lot of things...
				A way of thinking/designing
				A way of life
				A side-effect of good (or trivially simple ;) code/design
				Good design and conforming code makes XP easy to achieve
				A side-effect of an implementation language
	So what does the Abi-Framework mean?
				Abi on Windows looks like MSWord.
				Abi on Gnome looks like Gnumeric or Evolution
				Native component use/reuse
				AbiWord achieves true integration with its host platform
				Able to achieve anything that the underlying platform provides
				Similar functionality is implemented on each platform

So where does GNOME fit into the Abi framework?
	Outright XP library usage
			LibOLE2
			GLib
			GTK+
	Gnome Libs currently used
			Gnome Libs
			Gnome Print 
			GAL
			Gnome Libs that will be used in the very near future
				Bonobo
				GConf
				GB ?

End result ?
	Strive to push more things into lower-level libs
	GAL,  Gnome Print, etc...
	Put more functionality into these libs
	Print to PDF, Fax
	More 'clean' widgets not in GTK+ or Gnome Libs/UI
	Get all Gnome apps to use these libs
	Everyone benefits
