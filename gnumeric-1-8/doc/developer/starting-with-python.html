    <h1>HOWTO: Python Programming in Gnumeric</h1>
	
	<p>I am writing this to help people who want to write Gnumeric
	scripts in Python, without digging through the Gnumeric C
	documentation and source code. The installation section is
	targetted mainly for Debian, but I hope the alternate instructions
	will work on other systems. Travis Whitton wrote a nice <a
	href="http://grub.ath.cx/gnumeric-python/">Python/Gnumeric guide
	for the old API in Gnumeric 1.0.</a> Here's the new one written
	when 1.1.18 was being released. The API may change again. With
	luck I'll update this HOWTO.</p>

	<p>If you need help online, you may want to check out:
	  <ul>
	  <li>The Gnumeric Function-Writer's Guide. Until I write one for
		Python, you'll have to settle for
		<code>doc/developer/writing-functions.sgml</code> in the
		Gnumeric source tree.</li>
	  <li>The files that actually define the Python interface. In
		particular, <code>plugins/python-loader/py-gnumeric.c</code>
		has good comments at the beginning.</li>
	  <li><a href="http://developer.gnome.org/tools/cvs.html">Gnome
		  CVS instructions</a></li>
	  <li>The gnumeric discussion list:
		<code>&lt;gnumeric-list@gnome.org&gt;</code></li>
	  <li>The IRC channel #gnumeric on the GimpNet server.  Right now, the project
		leader is Jody Goldberg (jody) and the Debianizer is:
		J.H.M. Dassen (jhm). Jody, Jon K. Hellan, and Zbigniew Chyla
		appear prominently in the Python ChangeLog.</li>
	  </ul>
	</p>

	<h2>Preliminaries</h2>
	<p>I'm going to define some variables here so that you can insert
	  the appropriate command or item for your system when they
	  occur. I'll prefix them all with '$'.</p>
	<ul>
	  <li><i>$root</i>: Do whatever you do to become root. The usual
		options are:
		<ul>
		  <li><code>su -</code> and hit &lt;Enter&gt;</code></li>
		  <li><code>sudo</code></li>
		  <li><code>fakeroot</code></li>  (works in some situations,
		but not all)
		</ul>
	<li><i>$version</i>: Whatever your current Gnumeric version
	  is. Some examples:
	  <ul>
		<li>1.1.17</li>
		<li>1.1.17-bonobo</li>
		<li>1.1.19</li>
	  </ul>
	</ul>

	<h2>In the Beginning (Installing and Building)</h2> 

	<p>You need to get Python and Gnumeric, and the Python plugin for
	  Gnumeric. You can get the binaries, the packaged source, or
	  the developing edge CVS.</p>

	<h3>Getting the binaries (Debian)</h3>
	<p>I've only tested this on sid (unstable). The version you get
	  from stable (woody) may not act quite the same.</p>
	<ol>
	  <li><i>$root</i> <code>apt-get install gnumeric gnumeric-python
		  python</code></li>
	</ol>

	<h3>Getting and building the current Debianized source</h3> 
	If you have Debian, and don't need the bleeding edge, this is
	<em>by far</em> the easiest way to get and build the source.
	<ol>
	  <li>Change to a directory where you want to hang the source directory.</li>
	  <li><i>$root</i> <code>apt-get build-dep
		  gnumeric</code></li>
	  <li><code>apt-get source gnumeric</code></li>
	  <li><code>cd gnumeric-<i>$version</i></code></li>
	  <li><code>debian/rules build</code>
	  <li>To make the .deb packages: <i>$root</i> <code>./debian/rules
		  binary</code></li>
	  <li>To install those .deb packages: 
		<ol>
		  <li><code>cd ..</code> to change to that directory.</li>
		  <li><i>$root</i> <code>dpkg -i gnum*deb</code> (presuming
			you don't have other .deb packages beginning with "gnum" lying
			around here.</li>
		</ol>
	  </li>
	  <li>You may or may not want to remove those .deb files now: 
		<i>$root</i> <code>rm gnum*deb</code>)</li>
	</ol>
	
	<h3>Getting and building the source from CVS-HEAD</h3>
	<p>Remember that this is the developing edge. Things may not
	  work. Generally don't do this unless you are subscribed to the
	  mail list and possibly also on the IRC channel.</p>
	<ol>
	  <li>Change to a directory where you want to hang the source
		directory for Gnumeric and a few other Gnome things.</li>
	  <li><code>export
		  CVSROOT=:pserver:anonymous@anoncvs.gnome.org:/cvs/gnome</code></li>
	  <li><code>cvs login</code> (No password -- hit RETURN.)
	  <li><h4>Getting and building libgsf</h4>
		<ol>
		  <li>cvs co libgsf</li>
		  <li>cd libgsf</li>
		  <li>RedHat: <code>./autogen.sh</code></li>
		  <li>Debian: <code>./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr --with-gconf-schema-file-dir=/etc/gconf/schemas</code></li>
		  <li><code>make</code></li>
		  <li><i>$root</i> <code>make install</code></li>
		</ol>
	  </li>
	  <li><h4>Getting and building libgal</h4>
		  <p><b>No longer necessary! (13 June 2003)</b></p>
<!--		<ol>
		  <li><code>cvs co gal</code></li>
		  <li><code>cd gal</code></li>
		  <li>RedHat: <code>./autogen.sh</code></li>
		  <li>Debian: <code>./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr --with-gconf-schema-file-dir=/etc/gconf/schemas</code></li>
		  <li><code>make</code></li>
		  <li><i>$root</i> <code>make install</code></li>
		</ol>
-->
	  </li>
	  <li><h4>Getting and building gnumeric</h4>
		<ol>
		  <li><code>cvs -z3 checkout gnumeric -d
			  gnumeric-head</code></li>
		  <li><code>cd gnumeric-head</code></li>
		  <li>RedHat: <code>./autogen.sh</code> and wait while it
			compiles</li>
		  <li>Debian: <code>./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr --with-gconf-schema-file-dir=/etc/gconf/schemas</code></li>
		  <li><code>make</code></li>
		  <li><b>Optional:</b> <i>$root</i> <code>make install</code></li>
		</ol>
	  </li>
	</ol>

	<p>OK, you should now have gnumeric! Test it! If you installed the
	Debianized version via apt-get, or did "make install", it should
	be installed to /usr/bin (or /usr/local/bin on RedHat?)  and you
	can just type <code>gnumeric</code>. Otherwise you will find it in
	<code>gnumeric-head/src/</code> and you will have to run it from
	there. </p>

	<h2>The Python Console</h2>

	<h3>Enabling the Python Console</h3>

	<p>You can run a Python interpreter from inside Gnumeric, but you
	have to turn it on. To do this you simply uncomment a line in
	python-loader/plugins.xml. Now, normally, that file lives in
	/usr/lib/gnumeric/<i>$version</i>/plugins/python-loader/, but you
	should probably make a local copy. So:
	<ul>
		<li><code>gnumeric --version</code> to make sure you get the
		  right version name for the following</li>
	  <li><code>cd ~/.gnumeric/<i>$version</i>/plugins/</code></li>
	  <li><code>rsync -auvz
		/usr/lib/gnumeric/<i>$version</i>/plugins/python-loader
			./</code></li>
	  <li>Edit python-loader/plugin.xml</li>
	  <li>Uncomment the 5 ui-console-menu service lines near the bottom (remove the "&lt;!--" and
	  "--&gt;" tags around the &lt;service...&gt; and &lt;/service&gt; tags.</li>
	  <li>Save the file</li>
	  <li>Start gnumeric (same version)</li>
	  <li>Select Tools -> Python console</li>
	  <li><i>Enjoy!</i> 
	  </ul>
	</p>

	<h3>Playing with the Python console</h3> 

    <p>At the top there is a drop-down menu "Execute in". Right now
    your only choice will be "Default". After you evaluate functions
    from other plugins, those environments will become available too
    (JK says this is called lazy loading). But I'll assume you are
    using Default. (The only real difference is that you have to
    import Gnumeric first, and you can't see your plugin
    functions.)</p>

	<p>(Note: prior to the cvs release of (16 June 2003), you need to
	type "print" to get any output. So "print dir()" rather than
	"dir()".</p>


	<p>Let's start by taking a look at the environment.
<pre>
>>> import Gnumeric
>>> dir()
['Gnumeric', '__builtins__', '__doc__', '__name__']
</pre>
</p>
	<p>'Gnumeric' is a module that exists only within Gnumeric, and
	  which defines the Gnumeric Python API. Let's see it:
<pre>
>>> dir(Gnumeric)
['Boolean', 'CellPos', 'FALSE', 'GnumericError', 'GnumericErrorDIV0',
'GnumericErrorNA', 'GnumericErrorNAME', 'GnumericErrorNULL',
'GnumericErrorNUM', 'GnumericErrorRECALC', 'GnumericErrorREF',
'GnumericErrorVALUE', 'MStyle', 'Range', 'TRUE', 'Workbooks',
'__doc__', '__name__', 'functions', 'plugin_info']
</pre>
</p>

	<p>Items of note:
	<ul>
	  <li>Gnumeric.functions is the list of all the Gnumeric functions
		you would see in the function browser. You cannot yet do
		<code>dir(Gnumeric.functions)</code> but maybe someone
		will bind that soon.</li>

	  <li>RangeRef is not listed. That seems to limit us, though later
	  in the tutorial we'll see how to use regular functions to get
	  inside RangeRefs.</li>

      <li>The UI stuff is not in the Python bindings yet. :-( </li>
</ul>

<p>So do some exploring. First, let's poke around to figure out how to
use CellPos.
<pre>
# I wonder how to use CellPos (I've glanced at the source, but...)

>>> dir(Gnumeric.CellPos)                 # shows nothing useful

>>> Gnumeric.CellPos()                    
TypeError: CellPos() takes exactly 2 arguments (0 given)  

>>> Gnumeric.CellPos("a1","a2") 
TypeError: an integer is required.        # Right. 

>>> a=Gnumeric.CellPos(1,2)               # It worked!
>>> a
&lt;CellPos object at 0x106b6eb8&gt;      # Yeah, I know...

>>> dir(a)
['get_tuple']

>>> a.get_tuple()
(1,2)                                     # Cool. That's (col,row)
</pre>
</p>

<p>Similarly, we can explore Gnumeric.Range:
<pre>
>>> r = Gnumeric.Range((1,2),(3,4))
TypeError: Range() argument 1 must be CellPos, not tuple

>>> r = Gnumeric.Range(a,a)
>>> r
&lt;Range object at 0x1071d888&gt;

>>> dir(r)
['get_tuple']

>>> r.get_tuple()
(3, 7, 3, 7)
</pre>

<p>Faster than reading the source code? Maybe. Maybe not. If you
evaluate in the context of a plugin (rather than in Default), then
<code>dir(Gnumeric.plugin_info)</code> will reveal some simple
informational functions you can call for the local plugin(s).</p>

<p>Note: obviously I don't really know what I'm doing, or I wouldn't
be poking around like this.</p>



	<h3>More fun with the Python console</h3>

	<p>Jon K. Hellan writes, "Here are some more things you can do
	  from the console:"</p>
<pre>
# Get a workbook
>>> wb=Gnumeric.Workbooks()[0]
>>> wb
&lt;Workbook object at 0x862a490&gt;
>>> dir(wb)
>>> ['get_sheets']

# Get a sheet
>>> s=wb.get_sheets()[0]
>>> s
&lt;Sheet object at 0x863e8d0&gt;
>>> dir(s)
['cell_fetch', 'get_extent', 'get_name_unquoted', 'rename',
'style_apply_range', 'style_get', 'style_set_pos', 'style_set_range']

# Get a cell. s.cell_fetch(0,0) and s[0,0] are synonyms. First
# coordinate is columns, i.e. s[1,0] is B1.
>>> c=s[0,0]
>>> c
&lt;Cell object at 0x863d810&gt;
>>> dir(c)
['get_entered_text', 'get_mstyle', 'get_rendered_text', 'get_value',
'get_value_as_string', 'set_text']

# Change the cell - it changes in the grid
>>> c.set_text('foo')

# Retrieve the cell - both ways.
>>> c.get_value()
foo
>>> s.cell_fetch(0,0).get_value()
foo
</pre>

<p>Pretty cool, IMHO. Note, after setting a value, it won't show up
until that cell is redrawn. That will happen automatically with plugin
functions, but in the console, you may have to click on the cell.</p>                                                                            


	<h2>Using the built-in Python functions</h2>
	
	<p>Enable the Python-loader and Python plugins:  Go to Tools -> Plugins and
	  then select "Python plugin loader" and "Python
	  functions". Restart Gnumeric.</p>

	<p>The quickest way to test whether you now have Python functions
	  is to type <code>=py_capwords("fred flintstone")</code> in the
	  first cell. After you hit &lt;Enter&gt;, you should see "Fred
	  Flintstone". (Oddly enough, the first time I do this, I get an
	  error. Then it works fine in another cell, and fine again if I
	  go back to the first cell.)</p>

	<p>You can also click on the functions button, and scroll down to
	  the "Python" category. Select that. You should see at
	  least two functions defined: PY_CAPWORDS and PY_PRINTF. They're
	  not very useful, but they prove you've got the plugins. Test
	  them either via the GUI or by typing into the cell.</p>

	<p>I'll presume they worked.</p>

	<h2>Writing your own Python functions</h2>

	<p>To scribe new magic you must write your spells in places where
	  Gnumeric will find them. That place is in folders under:
	  <center>~/.gnumeric/&lt;version&gt;/plugins/</center>
	Each folder under here is one "spellbook" of new plugin
	functions. You may put all your spells in one spellbook, or group
	them neatly depending on your tastes. Each spellbook must have two
	files. We'll create a spellbook called "myfuncs". A pedestrian name
	for pedestrian spells. When I have more skill, perhaps I'll make
	some with better names. Several suggest themselves:
	<ul>
	  <li>Transformations: of obvious value for a spreadsheet</li>
	  <li>Illusions: statistical functions, clearly</li>
	  <li>Charms: presentation graphics</li>
	  <li>Necromancy: file repair and missing values?</li>
	  <li>Divination: data mining!</li>
	</ul>
	</p>

	<h2>Prepare the spellbook</h2>

	<p>In many ways it would be easier to start by copying the
	  py_func spellbook to your local .gnumeric folder, and just adding a
	  function to that. But in general it will be more useful to be
	  able to write your own separate spellbooks, so here we go.</p>

	<h3>Make the folder</h3>

	<p>First we make the folders and get into the right one. As noted
	  above, we'll call our folder (spellbook) myfuncs.</p>
	<ol>
	  <li>If they don't already exist:
		<ol>
		  <li><code>mkdir ~/.gnumeric</code></li>
		  <li><code>mkdir ~/.gnumeric/&lt;version&gt;</code></li>
		</ol>
	  <li><code>mkdir ~/.gnumeric/&lt;version&gt;/myfuncs/</code></li>
	  <li><code>cd ~/.gnumeric/&lt;version&gt;/myfuncs/</code></li>
	</ol>

	<h3>Make the files</h3>
	<p>A spellbook has two files. The first is the python file
	with the functions. The second is the XML file "plugin.xml". The
	XML file holds that master spells that tell Gnumeric what
	functions we've defined, and what the name of the python file
	<i>is</i>, and one other important item. We'll create these as
	blank files.</p>
	<ol>
	  <li><code>touch my-func.py</code></li>
	  <li><code>touch plugin.xml</code></li>
	</ol>

	<h3>Write the master spells</h3>
	<p>The good news is that you only need to do this once per
	  spellbook. After that you just add spells to it.</p>

	<p>Your XML file must tell Gnumeric about your plugin. Here is a
	  simple template. (If you want to learn about internationalization,
	  see the example in the system's py-func spellbook.) Open up
	  plugin.xml and insert the following lines:</p>

<pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
&lt;plugin id="Gnumeric_MyFuncPlugin"&gt;
	&lt;information&gt;
		&lt;name&gt;Other Python functions from HOWTO&lt;/name&gt;
		&lt;description&gt;A few extra python functions demonstrating the API.&lt;/description&gt;
	&lt;/information&gt;
	&lt;loader type="Gnumeric_PythonLoader:python"&gt;
		&lt;attribute name="module_name" value="<b>my-func</b>"/&gt;
	&lt;/loader&gt;
	&lt;services&gt;
		&lt;service type="function_group" id="<b>example</b>"&gt;
			&lt;category&gt;Local Python&lt;/category&gt;
			&lt;functions&gt;
			&lt;/functions&gt;
		&lt;/service&gt;
	&lt;/services&gt;
&lt;/plugin&gt;
</pre>

	<h3>Prepare to write the spells</h3>
	<p>Next we'll create a minimal python file. The python file has to
	be named <b>my-func</b>.py because <b>my-func</b> is the value of
	module_name in the xml listing above. This file must have a
	dictionary called <b>example</b>_functions because <b>example</b>
	is the value of function_group in the xml above. So open up
	my-func.py and insert the following lines.</p>
<pre>
# my-func.py
#

from Gnumeric import GnumericError GnumericErrorVALUE
import Gnumeric
import string
	
example_functions = {
}
</pre>


	<h2>Writing new spells</h2>

	<p>To add new functions to Python, you now must do five things
	  (three sir!):
	<ol>
	  <li>Write the python function in your copy of
		<code>my-func.py</code>.</li>
	  
	  <li>Insert the function info into the <code>example_functions</code>
		dictionary at the end of <code>my_func.py</code></li>
	  
	  <li>Insert the function name into the functions list at the end of
		<code>plugin.xml</code>.</li>
	</ol>
	
	
	<h3>Writing a simple script</h3>
	<p>Let's do something very simple: add two numbers
	  together. First, edit my-func.py.</p>
	<pre>
    <i># Add two numbers together</i>
    def func_add(num1, num2):
        return num1 + num2

    <i># Translate the func_add python function to a gnumeric function and register it</i>
    example_functions = {
        'py_add': func_add
    }
	</pre>

	<p>Then let the plugin-loader(?) know about your function. Add the
	following line near the end of plugin.xml (between
	  &lt;functions&gt; and &lt;/functions&gt;).</p>
	<pre>
                 &lt;function name="py_add"/&gt;
	</pre>

	<p>Now start Gnumeric and type <code>py_add(2,3)</code> into a
	  cell. You should get "5". You can also use cell references. If
	  that was in cell A1, go to cell A2 and type
	  <code>py_add(A1,3)</code> and you will get "8".  But your
	  function won't show up in the GUI list yet.</p>

	<h3>Tell the GUI</h3>
	<p>To make your function show up in the GUI, you have to tell
	  Gnumeric some things about it via a standard header, like
	  this:</p>
	<pre>
    <i># Add two numbers together</i>
    def func_add(num1, num2):
        '@FUNCTION=PY_ADD\n'\
        '@SYNTAX=py_add(num1, num2)\n'\
        '@DESCRIPTION=Adds two numbers together.\n'\
        'Look, the description can go onto other lines.\n\n'\
        '@EXAMPLES=To add two constants, just type them in: py_add(2,3)\n'\
        'To add two cells, use the cell addresses: py_add(A1,A2)\n\n'\
        '@SEEALSO='

        return num1 + num2
</pre>

	<p>The text after '@DESCRIPTION=' is the description that shows up
	  in the function GUI. You can make it as simple or detailed as you
	  want. I'm not sure how many other fields get used right now, as I
	  haven't seen the EXAMPLES show up anywhere.</p>
	
	<p>But this still isn't quite right. Gnumeric doesn't know how
	many arguments the function can handle, nor of what type. So the
	function GUI will prompt for the two values it knows about (as
	type "Any") and then keep prompting for more. But py_add cannot
	accept all types, nor can it handle more than two arguments, so
	unless you give it precisely 2 numbers, you will get an error when
	you click "OK".</p>

	<h3>Know your limits...</h3>
	<p>We got away last time just because Gnumeric was forgiving. Now
	  we need to say that we can accept only 2 values, of type
	  floating-point (which will also handle ints).</p>

	<p>Where before we had: <code>'py_add': func_add</code><br>
	  we should now put: <code>'py_add': ('ff','num1,num2',func_add)</code><br>
	  This says that Gnumeric should expect two floating-point numbers
	  ('ff') with names 'num1' and 'num2', and pass them to func_add.</p>

	<h3>...and surpass them</h3>
	<p>Of course, there is no reason an add function shouldn't be able
	  to handle a range. The simplest way to do that is to accept a
	  range, and then call Gnumeric's own SUM function on it! All of
	  Gnumeric's functions are available to you in the dictionary
	  Gnumeric.functions, keyed by name. So here is how to write py_sum.
	  </p>

	<ol>
	  <li>First, define func_sum (in my-func.py):<br>
<pre>
def func_sum(gRange):
	'@FUNCTION=PY_SUM\n'\
	'@SYNTAX=PY_SUM(range)\n'\
	'@DESCRIPTION=Adds a range of numbers together.'\
	'Just like built-in SUM.\n\n'\
	'@EXAMPLES=To add values in A1 to A5, just type them in:\n'\
	'    py_sum(a1:a5)\n'\
	'@SEEALSO='
	try:
		sum = Gnumeric.functions['sum']
		val = sum(gRange)
		#  val = reduce(lambda a,b: a+b, vals)
	except TypeError:
		raise GnumericError, GnumericErrorVALUE
	else:
		return val
</pre>
		</li>
	  <li>Then insert it into your functions dictionary. That
		dictionary now looks like this (with 'r' denoting a range type):
<pre>
example_functions = {
	'py_add': ('ff','num1,num2',func_add),
	'py_sum': ('r', 'values', func_sum)
}
</pre>
		</li>
	  <li>Finally, make an entry in the XML list, so that it now looks
		like:
<pre>
			&lt;functions&gt;
				&lt;function name="py_add"/&gt;
				&lt;function name="py_sum"/&gt;
			&lt;/functions&gt;
</pre>
		</ol>

	<p>I told you this was the easy way to do it. Obviously it's not
	  very useful to just duplicate Gnumeric functions. But that's as
	  far as I've made it. From what can tell, range objects are
	  packaged as opaque pointers of type RangeRefObject. There seems
	  to be no way to work with them from within Python, so we must
	  rely on the Gnumeric functions.</p>

   <h3>Do it yourself (mostly)</h3>

    <p>All is not lost, despite the opaque pointers. For in Gnumeric
    we can read about all the functions that have been defined. Some
    of those take references (including RangeRefs) and return useful
    information. For example, under "Lookup" we find "Column" and
    "Row" which return arrays of all the column (or row) indices in
    the range. So we can redo the sum function.</p>

    <p>Presume we can convert our RangeRef to a start tuple and and
    end tuple. Then we can write sum2:
<pre>
def func_sum2(gRange):
	'@FUNCTION=PY_SUM2\n'\
	'@SYNTAX=PY_SUM2(range)\n'\
	'@DESCRIPTION=Adds a range of numbers together,'\
	'without calling built-in SUM.\n\n'\
	'@EXAMPLES=To add values in A1 to A5, just type them in:\n'\
	'    py_sum(a1:a5)\n'\
	'@SEEALSO='
	try:

</pre></p>

    <p>That's fine as far as it goes, but we need to define the helper
    function "range_ref_to_tuples". Although I'm rather ashamed to
    show this ugly code, here's how I did it (someone suggest a
    better way, please!):
<pre>
def range_ref_to_tuples(range_ref):
	'''I need a function to find the bounds of a RangeRef. This one
	extracts them from the Gnumeric "column" and "row" commands, and
	returns them as a pair of tuples. Surely there is a better way?
	For example, return a list of cells??'''

	col  = Gnumeric.functions['column']   
	row  = Gnumeric.functions['row']

	# "column" and "row" take references and return an array of col or row
	# nums for each cell in the reference. For example, [[1, 1, 1], [2, 2, 2]]
	# for columns and [[2, 3, 4], [2, 3, 4]] for rows.

	try:
		columns = col(range_ref)
		rows    = row(range_ref)

		begin_col = columns[0][0] - 1  
		begin_row = rows[0][0] - 1     

		end_col = columns[-1][-1]
		end_row = rows[-1][-1]

		# We subtracted 1 from the begin values because in the API,
		# indexing begins at 0, while "column" and "row" begin at 1.
		# We did NOT subtract 1 from the end values, in order to make
		# them suitable for Python's range(begin, end) paradigm.
		
	except TypeError:
		raise GnumericError,GnumericErrorVALUE
	except NameError:                     # right name?
		raise GnumericError,Gnumeric.GnumericErrorNAME
	except RefError:                     # right name?
		raise GnumericError,Gnumeric.GnumericErrorREF
	except NumError:                     # right name?
		raise GnumericError,Gnumeric.GnumericErrorNUM


	return [ (begin_col, begin_row), (end_col, end_row) ]
</pre>
</p>

    <p>From there, insert the function into the dictionary, and insert
    its name into <code>plugin.xml</code>. I leave these as exercises
    to the reader (answers in the sample files -- no
    peeking!). Restart Gnumeric and you should be able to use
    py_sum2!</p>

    <p>There are a couple of glitches:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>It fails the first time with "could not import
      gobject". Just run again, I don't know what that's about.</li>

      <li>It will only work for Workbook 1 and Sheet 1. JK thinks that
      there may be no way to get the current Workbook/Sheet in the
      Python API. Hrm....</li>

      <li>As noted, it should do some simple trapping to skip blank or
      text-filled cells. That <i>can</i> be done! I just didn't. It's
      late.</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>More help</h3>
    <p>Relative to the source tree:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>The Python interface is defined in: <code>plugins/python-loader/py-gnumeric.c</code>
		That file also has good notes at the beginning.</li>
	  <li>There are interesting things about the way it used to be in:
		<code>doc/developer/python-gnumeric.txt</code>.</li>
	</ul>
	</p>

	  <h3>Program Listings</h3>
	<p>You can see my examples in full, with more comments:
	<ul>
		<li><a href="myfuncs/my-func.py"><code>my-func.py</code></a></li>
		<li><a
		  href="myfuncs/plugin.xml"><code>plugin.xml</code></a></li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	  
	  <h2>Upgrading</h2>

	<p>To upgrade, first choose any method from the installation section above. But
	note: when you upgrade your Gnumeric version, it will look for
	your Python scripts in the corresponding version-named
	subdirectories. For example, if your scripts are in
	"~/.gnumeric/1.1.17/plugins", but you just upgraded to 1.1.18, you
	may need to rename that (or copy them) to
	"~/.gnumeric/1.1.18/plugins". If you enabled the Python console,
	you'll probably have to do that again for the new version. I
		suspect that just copying the old one won't work.</p>

	  <p>Find the new version with <code>gnumeric --version</code>,
		making sure to invoke the proper gnumeric.</p>


	<h2>Fancy tricks</h2>

	<p>To be written....</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Swapping ranges (not a normal cell function, but I wrote
      one)</li>

      <li>Inserting commands into the menu bars (seems to require C)</li>
    </ul>


	<h2>Features wanted, and Questions</h2>
	<ul>
	  <li>Figure out why py_capwords and py_sum2 won't run the first
	  time you try, but will after that.</li> 

      <li>Is it really impossible to determine the current
      workbook/sheet from Python? That's a bummer.</li>

      <li>Several previous items are no longer on this list, due to
      the diligence of the Gnumeric hackers.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Credits</h2>
	<ul>
	  <li>Travis Whitton for the old HOWTO</li>

	  <li>Jon K. Hellan for the old python-gnumeric.txt</li>

	  <li>Nathan Hurst for the idea, help getting Gnumeric Python
		running, HOWTO testing, coffee, and insight.</li>

	  <li>The Gnumeric team esp. Jody and JHM for help as I got
	  started, and Jon K. Hellan for help, sample files, and
	  corrections. They've all been very patient and forthcoming, for
	  which I'm very grateful.</li>
	</ul>
