Hard carriage returns are entered with alt-enter

Automatic completion of names is done per column (looked backwards)

Alt-down arrow pops up a list of available choices for the autofill

* FORMULAS:
	
	Operators, cell references, values, worsheet functions,
	and names.

	Arrays:  SUM({1,2,3}*4) gets converted to:
		SUM({1,2,3}*{4,4,4})

** Operators
	
*** Arithmetic

	+, -, /, *, 
	% (percent, as in 20%)
	^ Exponentiation

*** Comparision
	=, <, >, <=, >= <>

*** Text operator

	& Concatenates values and returns a string value

*** Reference operator
	
	Range (colon) Produces one reference to all the cells between
	and includig the two references.

	Union (comma) Produces one reference that includes the two
	references

	Intersection (space) Produces on reference to cells common
	to the two references

** Wierd things
	="1"+"2" yields 3, Excel does the converion to integers
	="A"&TRUE, Excel convers TRUE to a string: ATRUE

** Display

	Control-` Switches between computed formula display and
	actual formua display

** References
	$ is the absolute cell reference
	R[-2]C	Two rows above, same column
	R[2]C[2] two column down, two right
	R2C2 Absolute reference to B2
	R[-1] Entire row above the active cell
	R current row
	
	=Sheet4!D12+4
	='Miguel is a moron'!A1+2
	
** Functions
	They can take any number of arguments
		X(number)
	They are documented
	The arguments are documented
	A wizard can be popped up to help with it
	
*** Types
	Database and list management functions
	Date and time functions
	DDE and external functions
	Engineering functions
	Financial functions
	Information functons
	Logical functions
	Lookup and reference functions
	Math and trigonometric functions
