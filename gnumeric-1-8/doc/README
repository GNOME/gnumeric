Each language has its own directory where the translated documentation
goes. 'C' being the default (English) language.

In order to avoid useless weight it is a good idea to use the images
in the C/figures/ directory, that is using relative paths as 
"../C/figures/image_name" and only use "figures/image_name" (that is using
an images/ directory under the specific language directory) for those
images where a translation is useful (images whith text strings for
example).
