  <title>Working with Gnumeric</title>

  <para>
    Using a spreadsheet generally involves several steps. First the
    application is started to obtain an empty workbook, which
    generally has several empty worksheets. Next, data and formulas
    are entered into one or several sheets. The data may be entered by
    hand or imported from external files. The formulas are generally
    entered by hand, possibly with the help of various tools. The data
    may be formatted to appear in particular ways and to clarify the
    structure of the data in the worksheet. A user may also create
    several graphical plots. Certain parts of the spreadsheets may be
    printed out as tables. The work is then usually saved into a file
    which can be re-opened later to add or modify the contents of the
    workbook.
  </para>

  <note>
    <para>
      The terminology can be confusing. A spreadsheet file contains a
      workbook and possibly some other information about the
      file. (Because the workbook is far more important than the extra
      information, the files themselves are often called workbooks.) A
      workbook contains one or more worksheets. Each worksheet
      contains a large number of cells usually arranged into a two
      dimensional grid made up of columns and rows. 
      We introduce the names of the parts of 
      &gnum; below in 
      <xref linkend="quick-parts-of-gnumeric" /> and explain the parts 
      further in <xref linkend="chapter-gui-elements"/>.

<sect1 id="quick-data">
  <title>Data in Gnumeric</title>

  <para>
    The main purpose of spreadsheets like
    &gnum; is to collect information in a
    coherent manner, perform calculations on the information and then
    be able to update those calculations easily if the original
    numbers change. The use of a spreadsheet therefore requires a
    substantial understanding of the types of information which can be
    entered into the spreadsheet and the methods which can be used to
    manipulate that information. This section explains how you can use
    data in &gnum;.
  </para>

    <sect2 id="quick-data-datatypes">
    <title>The Types of Data in a Spreadsheet</title>

    <para>
      Spreadsheets like &gnum; treat
      information by separating the data into separate cells and
      considering the data in each cell to be separate elements. Each
      cell in the spreadsheet has both a value, which is what
      &gnum; manipulates, and a
      representation, which is what is actually shown. Understanding
      this distinction is complicated and make take some time if you are new
      to spreadsheets.
      time. This distinction between value and representation is one of the
      reasons spreadsheets are so useful.
    </para>

    <para>
      The cells of the spreadsheet are contained in the cell grid
      area. The cell grid area is the area with a white background and
      grey grid lines. The grid lines separate this area into separate
      cells. Each cell has a unique reference name which is the
      combination of the letters of the name of the column and the
      number of the row. For instance, the top, leftmost cell is the
      cell named "A1" and the cell two over to the right and four rows
      down is named "C4" because it is in the column labelled "C" and
      in the fourth row. Each of these cells can contain only one
      single datum.
    </para>

    <para>
      The datum contained in any cell will have one of five types: a
      text string type, a number type, a formula type, a boolean type
      or an error type. These five types of data values can then have
      various display formats so that, for instance, a number value
      can be displayed as a number, a monetary amount, a date or a
      time. Text strings are sequences of characters and punctuation
      marks and could, for example, contain textual information such
      as people's names. Number values are simply numbers but may be
      input and displayed in various formats including decimal
      numbers, dates, times, and numbers in scientific
      notation. Formulas are instructions to
      &gnum; to calculate a result. The
      power of spreadsheets comes from these formulas because the
      results of the calculation can depend on the contents of other
      cells. Boolean values are either TRUE or FALSE and can be used
      in logical statements. Error values are usually the result of
      mistakes or impossible calculations.
    </para>

  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="quick-data-input">
    <title>Putting Data into the Spreadsheet</title>

    <para>
      In order to enter data into the spreadsheet, you must first
      select a cell in which to place the information and then
      actually type the information on the keyboard. Once you have
      entered the information, &gnum;
      attempts to figure out both the appropriate data value type to
      assign to the cell and the appropriate data format in which to
      display this data value. Because this process is quite complex,
      you may occasionally need to actively select these
      parameters of the cells, which we explaine in <xref
      linkend="quick-format" /> below. The next two sections explain
      how to get data into a cell, first by moving the selection box
      to a desired cell and then by typing the data.
    </para>

    <sect3 id="quick-data-input-moveselection">
      <title>Moving the selection box</title>
      <para>
        In order to enter data into
        &gnum; you must place the selection box
        over the appropriate cell. The selection box appears on
        the cell grid as a double lined rectangle with a small grey
        square in the lower right corner of the box. By default the
        selection box surrounds the top, leftmost cell in the cell
        grid area.
      </para>

      <para>
        The simplest way to move the selection box is to use the
        mouse. If the mouse cursor is placed over the cell "C3" (the
        cursor will be represented as a thick white cross) and the
        left mouse button then clicked, the selection box will move to
        cell "C3". Note that the selection box can cover more than one
        cell if the mouse is dragged while being clicked. The use of
        these larger selections is explained below in <xref
        linkend="quick-complex-select" />.
      </para>

      <tip>
        <para>
          The selection box also causes the header of the column and
          row to change slightly. The headers will turn a darker shade
          of gray and the font of the letters and numbers turn
          bold. This helps indicate what is currently being selected.
        </para>
      </tip>

      <para>
        You can also move the selection box with the keyboard arrow
        keys. For instance, typing the right arrow twice and the down
        arrow once will move the selection box from the cell "C3" to
        the cell "E4".
      </para>

      <para>
        The selection box can be moved in other ways and will move in
        response to certain actions. These movements become intuitive
        after using &gnum; for a little
        while.
      </para>
    </sect3>

    <sect3 id="quick-data-input-input">
      <title>Data Input</title>

      <para>
        In order to enter data into a selected cell, you can simply
        start typing. The characters will then become part of the
        spreadsheet when you change the selection either by typing the
        <keycap>Enter</keycap> key, which moves the selection down one
        cell, by typing the <keycap>Tab</keycap> key, which moves the
        selection one cell to the right, or by selecting any other
        cell with the mouse.
      </para>

      <para>
        For example, you could use the mouse to select the cell four
        columns over (Column D) and three rows down (Row 3). Then you
        could type "Hello, this is a line of text." and then type
        the <keycap>Enter</keycap> key. The text would then appear in
        cell "D3" and, if the cells to the right are empty, would span
        into those cells so that the whole entry is visible. The
        selection box moves when you type the <keycap>Enter</keycap> 
        and will therefore appear afterwards in cell "D4", ready
        for the input of more data.
      </para>

      <note>
        <para>
          Note that as the data text is entered it appears in both the
          cell and in the data entry area (the area below the toolbars
          to the right of the equals (=) sign).
        </para>
      </note>

      <para>
        You can correct mistakes you make during data entry by
        using the <keycap>Backspace</keycap> key or the
        <keycap>Delete</keycap> key. Finer control can be obtained if
        the cursor is moved to the text entry area by clicking in the
        box to the right of the equals (=) sign with the
        mouse. Editing in the text entry area enables the arrow keys
        to navigate backwards and forwards within the text being

        As you enter data into the spreadsheet,
        &gnum; interprets the information
        in order, first, to assign it to a data category and, second,
        to give it an appropriate data display format. The entry will
        be assigned to one of the basic data types and possibly to a
        sub-type. Entries which start with an apostrophe (') are
        considered to be text no matter what the rest of the
        contents. Entries which start with an equals sign (=) are
        automatically considered to be a formula. Entries which are
        single numbers or which fall into commonly used patterns for
        dates or times will be considered to be numbers.

      <para>
        The simplest kind of input which
        &gnum; recognizes as numbers are
        standard numeric values. Technically, these are contiguous
        sequences of digits which may have a separator symbol between
        the thousands and another symbol indicating the decimal
        separator. These symbols follow the English convention by
        default (comma as thousand separator, period as decimal
        symbol) but will adopt the symbols appropriate for a different
        locality if &gnum; is launched in
        a particular way. For instance, in a French setting the period
        is the thousand separator symbol and the comma the decimal
        separator symbol.

        formula and removing the leading apostrophe (') before the
        equals sign.
      </para>

      <para>
        Formulas can be quite complex since the power of spreadsheets
        comes from these formulas. A simple example of the use of a
        formula is as follows: first, select cell B2 and input the
        value "3" into that cell. Second, select cell D4 and input
        (without the quotes) "=B2+2" and then type the
        <keycap>Enter</keycap> key. Cell D4 should display the value
        "5". If the value of cell B2 is changed from "3" to "100",
        &gnum; will automatically update
        the value of cell D4 to "102".
      </para>

      <para>
        A valid formula can be a simple arithmetic equation such as 
        <screen>
=3+4-1
        </screen>
        which uses a formula to make the cell equal to the value
        6.
      </para>

      <para>
        Formulas may include calls to functions. These are statements
        which indicate that more complex operations should be
        performed. For instance, a formula could be "=EXP(24)" which
        would give the value of e (the base of the natural logarithm)
        raised to the 24th power. The cell would then display
        "2.6489e+10".
      </para>

      <para>
        As was shown in the example above, formulas may contain
        `references' to the contents of another cell. In the example
        given above, the contents of the cell in the second column and
        the second row was used in a calculation by using the cell
        name "B2". These references mean that complex calculations can
        be automatically updated when one of the original values
        change. 
      </para>

      <para>
        You can make references to the cells in other worksheets and
        even to those in other workbooks (files). The basic format of
        a complete reference is made of the name of the file the
        reference is in, enclosed by square brackets, followed by the
        name of the sheet, followed by an exclamation point, followed
        by the letters of the column, followed by the number of the
        row. For example, a complete reference could be
        "[my_file.gnumeric]"Sheet3"!C3". These complete references can
        be shortened if the filename or sheet names are the same as
        that of the reference. "AE34" would refer to the cell in the
        current file, in the current worksheet which is in column "AE"
        and in row "34".
      </para>

      <para>
        References can refer to a range of contiguous range of
        cells. For instance, the reference "A1:E5" refers to all the
        cells from the top-left most cell of the current sheet to the
        cell five rows down and five rows over. This can be useful in
        a formula which uses a function such as MAX(). The formula
        "=MAX(A1:E5)" would display the value of the largest number
        value in this range of cells.

    The data in &gnum; are stored in the

    dictates how the data will be displayed, whether the cell will
    have borders and other information. Cell formatting can be quite
    confusing at first because it combines simple changes, such as the
    colour of the characters being displayed, with more complex ideas,
    such as how future changes to the cell will be interpreted.

    <title>Formatting the Display and Entry Data Types</title>

      Cell formats are most difficult to understand when they address

      data. This only arises with the options selected in the
      <guilabel>Number</guilabel> tab of the <guilabel>Format
      Cells</guilabel> dialog. While these ideas are complex, 
      you need to understand them early on as they are fundamental
      to spreadsheet use.
    </para>

    <para>
      When you enter data into &gnum;,
      the spreadsheet interprets the entry based on the input format
      of the cell. The default format of empty cells is the
      <guilabel>General</guilabel> format which instructs
      &gnum; to guess both the type of
      the data being entered and a suitable display format for that
      data type. However, you can change the <guilabel>General</guilabel>
      format to a specific format in order to alter both the way
      &gnum; interprets any future data
      input to the cell and the way data in the cell are displayed.
    </para>

    <note>
      <para>
        Changing the format does not alter the data type of data
        already in a cell but does alter the display format of that
        data. This means that the input format will only affect future
        input whereas the display format will affect both the data
        currently in the cell and any data placed later into the cell.
      </para>
    </note>

    <para>
      For example, if you enter "12/25/2000" (without the quotes),
      &gnum; guesses that this is a date
      and stores the value 36885. (The value
      &gnum; uses for dates is the number

      month, day and year, separated by slashes.
    </para>

    <important>
      <para>
        The order in which the formatting operations occur is
        critical. It is not possible to alter the type of a datum
        currently in a cell by formatting. To alter the interpretation
        of the data type in a cell, formatting must occur
        <emphasis>prior</emphasis> to the entry of the data.
      </para>
    </important>

    <para>
      It sometimes becomes necessary to override the "General" type if
      &gnum; is making an incorrect
      assessment of the data being entered. Postal Zip Codes in the
      United States, for instance, are incorrectly interpreted to be
      numbers. Some of these Zip Codes start with a leading zero which
      the "General" format type drops so the user must
      intervene to keep that zero displayed. In order to input these
      Zip Codes, the following steps must be performed. First, the
      cell must be selected. Next, the cell must be formatted to hold
      a "Text" value. This formatting changes both the interpretation
      of any future data entry into this cell and alters the display
      formatting of the cell. Finally, the Zip Code can be
      entered. Following these steps, the data value will be
      considered to be a "Text" value, any leading zeros will be
      retained and the data will be left justified since this is the
      default display format for "Text" values.

    <tip>
      <para>
        If you need to alter the data type of a whole column prior

    The contents of cells, both data values and formatting, can be

    <title>Moving Cell Contents</title>

    <para>
      The simplest way to move cell contents around a spreadsheet
      involves selecting a block of cells containing the contents to
      be moved, either "cutting" or "copying" those cells, selecting
      the location where these contents are to be moved and then
      pasting the data.
    </para>

    <para>
      Moving data can only be performed with a single selection of
      cells which means that only continuous rectangular blocks of
      cells can be moved. This does mean, however, that columns or
      rows can be moved as a unit. By default,
      &gnum; moves the entire contents of
      the cells including both the data values and the formatting of
      the cells.
    </para>

    <para>
      Once you have selected a group of cells, they can be "cut" or "copied"
      either using the <guimenu>Edit</guimenu> menu, the toolbar
      buttons (a pair of scissors or two pieces of paper, respectively),
      the right mouse button context menu or keyboard shortcuts
      (<keycombo><keysym>Ctrl</keysym><keysym>X</keysym></keycombo> or
      <keycombo><keysym>Ctrl</keysym><keysym>C</keysym></keycombo>
      respectively). If cells are "cut" the contents will be removed
      from the current location. If cells are "copied", the contents
      will be duplicated in the new location. These two operations
      treat cell references in formulas slightly differently. If cells
      are "cut", any references in the cells in the new location will
      remain pointed at the original cells. If cells are "copied", the
      references in the cells in the new location will point to cells
      in the same relative position.
    </para>

    <para>
      You can select the new location for the cells in two ways. The
      simplest is to select the top, left cell of the new
      location. Alternatively, you can select the whole new range of cells 
      but the shape of this new range must match exactly the
      dimensions of the original range which is more difficult.
    </para>

    <para>
      Finally you can "paste" the cell contents in the new location
      using either the <guimenu>Edit</guimenu> menu
      <guimenuitem>Paste</guimenuitem> menu entry, the toolbar button
      with a clipboard, the context menu
      <guimenuitem>Paste</guimenuitem> menu entry or the
      <keycombo><keysym>Ctrl</keysym><keysym>V</keysym></keycombo>
      keyboard shortcut.
    </para>

    <para>
      An alternative way to move cells in a current worksheet involves
      dragging and dropping the original selection. You select the cells to be
      moved as above. You then place the mouse cursor on
      the thick white selection border. If you click and hold the left hand
      button, you can drag the selected cells to a new
      location resulting in the same operation as a "cut" and a
      "paste". If you hold down the <keysym>Ctrl</keysym> key during
      the click and drag of the mouse, the result is the same as a
      "copy" and "paste" operation and can be repeated several times.
    </para>

    <para>
      Both the <guimenu>Edit</guimenu> menu and the context menu have
      an extra menu entry called <guimenuitem>Paste
      Special...</guimenuitem> which can be used during a cut and
      paste operation to selectively transfer some of the original the
      cell contents or to alter the contents in specific ways. This

    <title>Inserting and Deleting Cells</title>

    <para>
      A worksheet can also be altered by inserting or by deleting
      cells. These operations actually alter the locations of cells in
      a workbook.
    </para>

    <para>
      Inserting and deleting columns and rows are easy to
      understand. If you select a group of columns or rows, selecting
      the <guimenuitem>Column</guimenuitem> or
      <guimenuitem>Row</guimenuitem> menu entries in the
      <guimenu>Insert</guimenu> menu will add the same number of
      columns to the left of the selected columns or of rows above the
      selected rows. You can also use the context menu for the insert
      operation. The context menu can be used to delete the currently
      selected columns or rows.
    </para>

    <warning>
      <para>
        Insert operations can result in the loss of data if the last
        columns or rows currently contain information.
      </para>
    </warning>

    <para>
      Individual cells or contiguous rectangular blocks of cells can
      also be inserted and deleted. During this operation, you are
      asked which way to shift the current cells to allow the
      insertion or deletion of the selected cells. The movement can be
      along the rows or along the columns and will result in the
      relative movement of cells which were previously
      contiguous. This shift is the fundamental difference between
      insert and delete operations compared to cut or copy and paste
      operations.

<sect1 id="quick-sheets">
  <title>Sheets</title>

  <para>
    The worksheets in a workbook can be altered in several ways. The
    name of a particular worksheet can be altered. New sheets can be
    added. A current sheet can be duplicated or removed. The sheets
    can be reordered. Other sheets operations can alter the colour of
    the tabs or change the "protection" status of a worksheet to allow
    cells to be locked or hidden.
  </para>

  <para>
    The names of sheets can be changed. You can do this by editing
    the tab directly. Clicking twice on a tab will highlight the text
    and then standard editing operations will alter the text contents. 
  </para>

  <para>
    You can insert a new empty sheet after the current sheet through
    the <guimenuitem>Sheet</guimenuitem> menu entry in the
    <guimenu>Insert</guimenu> menu or through the context menu which
    appears when you click the right mouse button on a tab.
  </para>

  <para>
    Instead of an empty sheet, you can add a copy of the current worksheet 
    to the workbook after the current sheet by selecting the
    <guimenuitem>Duplicate this Sheet</guimenuitem> menu entry from
    the context menu.
  </para>

  <para>
    You can remove the current sheet using the <guimenuitem>Remove
    this Sheet</guimenuitem> menu entry from the context
    menu. 
    <warning>
      <para>
        Deleted sheets cannot be retrieved through the "Undo"
        mechanism and sheet deletion is therefore an irreversible operation. Be
        careful!
      </para>
    </warning>
  </para>

  <para>
    You can re-order worksheets by clicking and holding the left
    mouse button on a tab, then dragging that tab to the left or to
    the right. Little arrows will appear showing the location where
    the sheet will be placed. Releasing the mouse button will then
    move the sheet to this new position.

    through the <guimenuitem>Manage Sheets...</guimenuitem> menu entry

  <title>Graphing</title>

  <para>
    A major function of moderns spreadsheets is to provide a quick and
    easy way to plot numerical data in graphical charts of various
    kinds. The use of graphs provides users a way to explore data to
    discover relationships and trends in the data values. Graphs also
    provide an effective way to present data so as to demonstrate
    relationships in the data and summarize large amounts of data in
    an effective image. In &gnum;, both
    of these can be done easily and efficiently.
  </para>

  <warning>
    <title>Graphing is a work in progress</title>

    <para>
      The approach to the creation of graphical displays of data was
      completely redesigned in
      &gnum; version 1.2 and is still
      being improved. The ultimate goal is a system which will produce
      an elegant graph automatically but can be customized in detail
      according the user's preferences. This is a active area of
      programming development and therefore will be changing
      repeatedly in future versions.
    </para>

    <para>
      Information on the creation of graphical displays of data is
      presented in greater detail in <xref linkend="chapter-graphics"
      />. That chapter will be updated regularly during development to
      explain in detail how to produce and modify graphical displays
      of data.
    </para>

  </warning>  

  <para>
    When graphs are used to explore data, the aim is usually to
    produce a plot quickly with a minimum of effort. These plots are
    not designed to look polished but must present the required
    information as quickly as possible. To produce these graphs, users
    must learn a simple series of operations which will produce the
    desired plots. For speed, the most critical operation involves
    selecting the cells on the spreadsheet which will be used as data
    <emphasis>before</emphasis> starting the graphing process.
  </para>

  <para>
    Graphs which are used to present data must be carefully crafted to
    communicate effectively. Clarity of communication is the critical
    factor and the plot may include a large amount of work to ensure
    that the visual result of the plot helps to communicate the
    desired result.
    <tip>
      <para>
        The use of a graph may not be the best way to communicate
        information. A verbal explanation or a simple table are often
        sufficient and, because they are more compact, may be more
        effective ways to communicate.
      </para>
    </tip>
    &gnum; includes a large number of
    features which allow users to craft the look of a particular graph
    to maximize the effectiveness of the presentation. In
    &gnum;, it is possible to change the
    fonts, modify the borders of each element, add patterns and images
    to backgrounds, add patterns to plot elements and configure the
    graph in multiple ways. These features will be explained in detail
    below.
    <tip>
      <para>
        Graphs which use a large number of the graphical features
        available in &gnum; often appear
        cluttered. The visual richness of such images can often
        obscure the message contained in the presentation of the
        data. Spare, elegant and direct graphs will communicate
        results most effectively.

    workbook will be opened.  To save this workbook into a file, click
    on <menuchoice><guimenu>File</guimenu><guimenuitem>Save As
    &hellip; </guimenuitem></menuchoice>.  This brings up the file
    dialog where you can pick the filename and format for the book you
    are saving.  It is best to save the book in the <guilabel>Gnumeric
    XML file format</guilabel> the first time.  This allows you to
    easily edit the file without worrying about changes in the format
    and look of the book.

    Once the file has a name and a file format, saving subsequent
    changes can be done easily either through the
    <guimenu>File</guimenu> menu, through the toolbar or through a
    keyboard shortcut. Saving with the menu requires selecting the
    <guimenu>File</guimenu> and then the <guimenuitem>Save
    </guimenuitem> menu item. Saving with the toolbar simply requires
    clicking on 
	<inlinemediaobject>

	  </imageobject>
	  <textobject>
		<phrase>The "Save File" button</phrase>
	  </textobject>
	</inlinemediaobject>
    in the tool bar. Finally saving with a keyboard shortcut simply
    requires typing
    <keycombo><keysym>Ctrl</keysym><keysym>S</keysym></keycombo>.

    Sometimes you want your book to be saved often so you do not lose
    any work. To save the book at intervals click on
    <menuchoice><guimenu>Tools</guimenu> <guimenuitem>Auto Save
    &hellip;</guimenuitem></menuchoice>.  The <interface> Auto
    Save</interface> dialog appears.

    Click on the <guibutton>Automatic Save Every</guibutton> button
    and enter the number of minutes will pass between each save.  When
    the interval is shorter more of your work will be potentially
    saved, but &gnum; might appear
    sluggish.  If &gnum; is sluggish
    increase the time between saves.  The button <guibutton>Prompt
    Before Saving</guibutton> brings up a dialog to ask if you want to
    save the book.

      Using the automatic saving feature of
      &gnum; can save time but is
      dangerous. &gnum; does not create a
      new file each time a file is saved but instead
      &gnum; modifies the existing file
      which destroys the previous work. In certain situations, this
      feature can lead to the loss of possibly important work. Users
      are highly recommended to backup their work by copying the
      original file to a new name or by saving files to newly named
      files.

    An existing spreadsheet file can be opened in several ways. If the
    file has an icon on the desktop, this icon can be clicked or
    double-clicked with the mouse button. Similarly, if a file
    manager, such as the <application>Nautilus</application> file
    manager, lists the file, then the file name can be clicked and
    opened. If &gnum; is already opened,
    a file can be opened by clicking on the <guimenu>File</guimenu>
    and selecting the <guimenuitem>Open</guimenuitem> menu
    item. Alternatively, the "Open file" button on the toolbar,
	<inlinemediaobject>
	  <imageobject>

	  </imageobject>
	  <textobject>

	  </textobject>
	</inlinemediaobject>, 
    can be used or the <keysym>F3</keysym> key clicked.  All three of
    these open the <interface>Open File</interface> dialog.  You can
    then select the spreadsheet file you wish to open.
    &gnum; can open many different types
    of spreadsheet file formats.

      If the file has recently been opened in
      &gnum;, the file name will appear
      in the <guimenu>File</guimenu> menu and can simply be clicked to
      re-open the file.

  <title>Closing Gnumeric</title>

  <para>
    There are several ways to close
    &gnum;. The simplest is to select the
    <guimenu>File</guimenu> menu and then the
    <guimenuitem>Quit</guimenuitem> menu option at the bottom of the
    <guimenu>File</guimenu>.
  </para>

  <para>
    &gnum; can also be closed through the
    window manager by clicking on a close box in the window frame or
    through a pop-up menu. The placement of the box and the invocation
    of the menu depend on the particular window manager and the theme
    being used. If the GNOME panel is running the window list applet,
    clicking with the right mouse button opens a context menu with a
    <guimenuitem>Close</guimenuitem> which can be used to close
    &gnum;.
  </para>

  <note>
    <para>
      If any changes have been made to the workbook since the last
      time it was saved, a dialog will open to ask what is supposed to
      happen to the contents of the workbook. At this point the
      contents of the workbook can be saved (Save), the request to
      close gnumeric can be cancelled (Don't Quit) or the most recent
      changes can be discarded (Discard). If the user decides to save
      the content, a second dialog may open requesting a file name,
      location and type for the saved workbook.

      Any files which are saved by &gnum;
      must be deleted by the user. Either the GNOME file manager
      <application>Nautilus</application> or the shell tool
      <command>rm</command> can be used to delete the files.
