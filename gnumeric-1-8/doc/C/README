There are many hidden chapters that could be written.

Major issues:
------------
Bonobo-build: haven't seen it, don't know it's status/differences.
INDEX:
GLOSSARY:




TODO List:
---------
The TODO list can be obtained by 

grep -in todo *.xml

Add TODO items as self contained comments beginning at the start of the
line. 




Grep'able Comments:
------------------

<!-- TODO:        - These are things to be done.
<!-- Note:        - These are reminders of structures of the document
                    such as essentially parallel sections.
<!-- TODO: Ask    - These are requests for clarification.
<!-- TODO...Hack  - These are workarounds for the current yelp/gkthtml.





Adding and removing files:
-------------------------
All files added or removed must be sync'ed with the Makefile.am's

.xml files with C/Makefile.am
figures with C/figures/Makefile.am





Formatting:
----------
  Please keep the formatting consistent:
    - no tabs
    - indent is 2 spaces
    - text of paragraph indented from <para> tag
    - all elements indented unless the close tag fits on the same line




File-naming:
-----------
  Please name files in the same chapter with the same starting element

  Please name images in parallel to the current convention.
    - Button-
    - Dialog-



Id-naming:
---------
  Please use tags based on text placement in hierarchy
    - Start of tag describes what it is sect- fig- table-
    - Inside of tag is -chaptername-section-section...



Emacs:
-----
  Please do not append emacs tags at the end of files


Thanks.
