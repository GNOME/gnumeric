<!-- TODO: ask- In text import druid, what does row selection do? Why the highlight? -->

  <para>
    &gnum; can import data which is organized as text fields
    structured in some systematic fashion either from a file or from
    the clipboard. Importing structured text may require extensive
    intervention on the part of the user so &gnum; provides a
    <interface>Text Import</interface> druid, which is a three paneled
    dialog with configuration options. For text imported from files,
    this druid appears after the file has been opened, using the file
    format named "Text Import (configurable)" in the <interface>File
    Open</interface> dialog, as is explained in <xref
    linkend="sect-file-open" />. For text imported from the clipboard,
    the druid appears when a user attempts to paste the text into a
    worksheet, as is explained in <xref
    linkend="sect-movecopy-xclipboard" />.
  </para>

  <para>
    The text import druid contains three panels but the middle panel
    differs depending on the structuring system used, either with data
    fields separated by a special character or with data fields
    occurring at equally spaced intervals in each line. The first
    panel allows the user to configure the character encoding, line
    break characters, structuring system, and line range. The second
    panel allows the user to define the columns by either, for
    separated data, setting the separating character and text
    delimiting character, or, for fixed space data, by setting the
    column spacing. The third panel allows the user to select which
    columns to import and define their data types.

  <sect2 id="sect-file-textImport-complex">
    <title>The complexities of text format files</title>

    <para>
      The use of text format files to store and transmit data for use
      in a spreadsheet involves three somewhat complex decisions which
      determine how the file expresses and separates each data
      value. These complexities must be understood for a user to be
      able to use the <interface>Text Import</interface> druid
      effectively. These complexities exist because of the limitations
      of early computers and because or the historical development of
      computer systems by different manufacturers and programmers, in
      different countries, targeting different types of users,
      speaking different languages.
    </para>

    <para>
      The first complexity involves the different systems which relate
      the contents of a computer file to the characters in a written
      language. All text files on a computer consist of a long
      sequence of binary digits. Text files are files in which these
      digits are used to indicate different textual
      characters. Character 'encodings' are standardized systems which
      relate the binary digits in a computer file to a formal system
      of characters which includes both text glyphs (shapes) and
      formatting indicators. Each encoding defines a way to interpret
      the binary digits and uses the characters from a particular
      character set. The alternative character encoding strategies are
      explained in greater detail in <xref
      linkend="sect-file-textImport-complex-encoding"/>, below.
    </para>

    <para>
      The second complexity involves the decision of how to separate
      the characters in a file into different lines. Text files
      explicitly determine the end of each line of a file with a
      specific character or sequence of characters. The complexity
      involves the particular character sequence used to determine the
      end of each line. Different conventions have been used in
      different computer systems. The alternative line breaking
      strategies are explained in greater detail in <xref
      linkend="sect-file-textImport-complex-lineBreak"/>, below.
    </para>

    <para>
      The third complexity involves the decision of how to separate
      the characters in each line into separate value fields. Again,
      different strategies exist. These can be separated into two
      broad categories: strategies which use a character or sequence
      of characters to separate the values, so called 'delimited' or
      'separated' strategies, and strategies which use the position of
      the character in the line to separate the values, so called
      'fixed-width' strategies. The alternative data structuring
      strategies are explained in greater detail in <xref
      linkend="sect-file-textImport-complex-dataStruct"/>, below.
    </para>


    <para>
      Fortunately, the &gnum; <interface>Text Import</interface> druid
      provides users with a way to preview the information in a text
      file. This enables users to change the settings which determine
      each of these three conventions until the text in the preview
      correctly shows the contents of the data file. Therefore, while
      the details of these three steps are complex, the practical
      impact on users is minimal. Users can simply experiment until
      the file appears correct without having to understand each of
      these complexities in detail.
    </para>
 

  <sect3 id="sect-file-textImport-complex-encoding">
    <title>Character Encodings</title>


    <para>
      The use of text files to store data in a structured fashion for
      use by spreadsheet programs, and more generally all text files,
      require some scheme to relate the binary number in the computer
      file itself to the characters of a written language. Such
      schemes are called <wordasword>'encodings'</wordasword>.

    </para>

    <para>
      The origin of computers led to the invention of a number of
      different encoding schemes. Due to the limitation of early
      computer hardware, these encoding schemes all restricted
      themselves to character sets which contained only the most
      essential characters of the English language. The desire to
      support characters which were not in this basic set of
      characters led to the creation of new encoding schemes,
      many of which restricted themselves to the characters in
      specific languages. One encoding scheme, called UTF-8, has now
      emerged as the best encoding scheme for the future for a
      multitude of reasons including its ability to co-exist with
      current operating systems and its ability to encode all of the
      characters in the largest set of characters which has been
      consistently defined, the Universal Character Set. However, the
      existence of the diversity of encoding schemes means that for
      the foreseeable future, files will be created and distributed
      using several different schemes. This is especially true for
      files containing text in languages other than English.
    </para>

    <para>
      This complex situation generally does not impact users.  &gnum;
      has been designed to deal with most of the complexity. Many
      kinds of flies, such as the &gnum; file format itself, describe
      their encoding scheme internally in such a way that it can be
      easily recognized. &gnum; also provides an easy approach to
      changing the encoding scheme in case this proves necessary.
    </para>

    <para>
      Encoding schemes merely prove a hindrance to users when opening
      files. There is no danger that data be lost or that any other
      serious problem arise by selecting the wrong scheme. If the
      wrong scheme is selected, either the file will contain
      characters which are nonsensical and &gnum; will open an error
      dialog asking the user to select a different encoding scheme, or
      the preview area will display nonsensical characters. These
      nonsensical characters may simply be characters grouped
      together which do not occur in any language, such as
      "&#xE5;&#xD5;&#xDB;&#xDB;&#xDE;", or may be characters for which
      a graphical representation (a glyph) does not exist in the font
      being used and is therefore displayed using a small box with
      four numbers inside, such as &#x0080; and &#x0082;. Each of
      these errors indicates that the encoding scheme used to read the
      file was not the same encoding scheme as was used to create the
      file. The difficulty is then to determine what encoding scheme
      to use. A simple process of trial and error should lead to
      picking the right scheme.
   </para>

    <para>
      A basic strategy to find the right encoding for a file being
      imported into &gnum; is, first, to use the scheme proposed by
      &gnum; and, then, to hunt for the correct encoding. The default
      encoding scheme is the one defined by the locale setting of the
      user and this is also the default scheme &gnum; uses to create
      text files.
<!-- TODO: encoding- add xref to locale. -->

      If the default encoding is incorrect, the correct encoding must
      be found by trial and error. One strategy to use is to examine
      the major western encodings and then the major regional
      encodings. The major western encoding schemes are ASCII,
      ISO-8859-1, and UTF-8, but ASCII is a subset of the other two so
      it does not need to be tried on its own. The major regional
      encodings are the IS0-8859-x schemes since these have become
      quite popular in GNU operating systems. Alternatively, the
      various character sets used by the Microsoft operating systems
      can be attempted. The encoding schemes are listed under
      "Western", "Unicode", and the alphabet names.

  <sect3 id="sect-file-textImport-complex-lineBreak">
    <title>Line break delimiters</title>

     <para>
        The use of text files to store data in a structured fashion
        for use by spreadsheet programs requires a scheme to separate
        each line of the file. Structured text files rely on the files
        having explicitly defined rows within the file as one
        component in the structuring system. Each of these rows is
        defined by a character sequence indicating the end of a row.
     </para>

     <para>
       Two characters that are part of the ASCII code, an early
       encoding that became a widely followed standard, were included
       to help define the end of the line. These are the 'linefeed'
       character and the 'carriage return' character, named after the
       two processes which occur when a typewriter starts a new line:
       first the typewriter barrel rolls - the linefeed - then the
       whole carriage with the sheet of paper moves back to the
       starting point -the carriage return. In the same way that
       different computing systems have used different encoding
       schemes,  three different approaches became common for defining
       the end of the line.
     </para>

     <para>
       In GNU operating systems and other systems that inherit from
       the UNIX legacy, the end of a line was defined simply using the
       'linefeed' character. The Macintosh operating system chose
       instead to use only the 'carriage return' character. The
       Windows operating system uses both characters in the sequence
       'carriage return' then 'linefeed'. 
     </para>

     <para>
       A user opening a file into &gnum; will see, in the preview area
       of the <interface>Text Import</interface> druid, whether or not
       the line breaks have been recognized correctly and will be able
       to alter the recognition settings. An incompatible setup will
       either yield a single unbroken line of text, lines of text with
       extra, empty rows between them, or lines of text with extra
       symbols at the start or end of each line.
     </para>

<!-- TODO: ask- line break delimters Does having all 3 set ever not work? -->
     <para>
       The correct line break delimiters can be established by
       checking or unchecking the alternatives. The preview area will
       then show the result of the file interpreted with these
       settings. 
     </para>

<!-- TODO: write- section on data structuring strategies. -->

  <sect3 id="sect-file-textImport-complex-dataStruct">
    <title>Data Structuring Strategies</title>

     <para>
       The use of text files to store data in a structured fashion for
       use by spreadsheet programs also requires some scheme to
       separate each value within every line. Two different approaches
       are used to separate these values. The first strategy, uses a
       particular character or character sequence to denote the start
       and end of each value. Such strategies are called 'Separated
       Value' or 'Delimited Value' systems. The second strategy places
       each value stating at a specified position in the line. Such
       strategies are called 'Fixed Width' strategies because they
       inherently require that each value have a pre-determined size.
     </para>

     <para>
       Separated Value structuring systems distinguish the contents of
       each value using pre-determined characters to separate the
       values. Certain characters have become common in such schemes,
       for-example 'Comma Separated Value' files use a comma character
       to separate values while 'Tab Separated Value' files use a tab
       character. &gnum; allows the user to define the value separator
       to be any one of several common characters or a specific
       sequence of characters, either on their own or in
       combination. For example, a file could use both space
       characters and tab characters to separate values. Similarly, a
       file could be read which used the entire word 'STOP' to separate
       values like the common scheme to separate sentences in a
       telegram.
     </para>

     <para>
       Separate Value structuring systems often also include a method
       to surround a single text value which may itself contain the
       character used to separate values. The quote character is often
       used in this role but &gnum; allows users to configure any
       character in this role. For example, a file which used the
       comma to separate values could nonetheless contain a value like
       "Zoe, Sally, Dodji" if this value had appropriate text
       indicating characters at either end.
    </para>

    <para>
      Fixed Width structuring systems are common formats for the
      output of database tables since the contents of these tables
      have often been defined as variables of a particular size.
<!-- TODO: dataStruct- get example for dB variable CHAR14 -->
      To import these files, users must specify exactly the start of
      each column so that the importer can separate the values on each
      row.

	      <emphasis role="bold">1</emphasis> - The separator
	    definition area.
	    </term>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>

	        This are allows the user to define the characters used
	        to separate data value fields within each
	        row. The checkboxes can be pressed to add or remove
	        characters from those treated as
	        separators. Additionally, the 'custom' type allows the
	        user to define either other single characters, or a
	        particular character sequence used to separate
	        values. The preview area in the panel will show the
	        file processed with the rules which have already been
	        applied.
	      </para>

	      <para>
	        Generally, this type of file structuring uses a single
	        character to separate fields but it is possible to use
	        either several different characters or to use a
	        sequence of characters. For example, it would be
	        possible to use the old telegraphic convention of
	        separating phrases with the word 'STOP' by selecting
	        the 'custom' separator type and entering the character
	        sequence 'STOP' in the text field.
	      </para>

	      <para>
	        This area also includes a checkbox enabling two
	        separator sequences that immediately follow one
	        another, to be treated as a single separator. This
	        option will only be useful where data is imported with
	        one or more completely empty columns and no partially
	        filled columns. If this option is checked and the data
	        file has partially filled columns of data, the columns
	        will be jumbled during the text import operation.

	        Separated value files often additionally define a

	      <para>
	        For example, a file which is structured as a comma
	        separated value file, could use the double quotation

	        This left most button, named <guibutton>Auto Column

	        one result after this button has been pressed: many of
	        the columns were discovered automatically, but the
	        second and third columns were
	        misidentified. Nonetheless, the automatic mechanism
	        provides a useful starting point. The definition of

	      </para>
	      <para>
	        This area can also be used to define column
	        widths. When the panel first appears, a single column
	        will be defined. The automatic column discovery
	        mechanism may split this single column into many more
	        columns. The mouse can then be used to further divide
	        columns or to join previously separate columns.
	      </para>
	      <para>
	        A new column can be defined by placing the mouse
	        pointer where the column should start and
	        double-clicking with the primary mouse button. This
	        will split the column which used to contain this
	        position and add a new column starting at this
	        location.
	      </para>
	      <para>
	        To remove the definition of a column which already
	        exists or to alter the ending position of a column,
	        the context menu must be used. The context menu
	        appears by clicking with one of the secondary mouse
	        buttons. A column which has already been defined can
	        be merged with the column on the left or right using
	        the <guimenuitem>Delete and Merge Left</guimenuitem>
	        or <guimenuitem>Delete and Merge right</guimenuitem>
	        menu items. The size of a column can be increased by
	        placing the mouse pointer inside the column area or
	        header and using the <guimenuitem>Widen</guimenuitem>
	        or <guimenuitem>Narrow</guimenuitem> menu items,
	        respectively. Either of these will change the width of
	        the column by changing the right hand end of the
	        column.
	      </para>
	      <para>
	        The context menu can also be used to define new
	        columns using the <guimenuitem>Split</guimenuitem> menu
	        item but the double-click approach described above
	        should be easier.
