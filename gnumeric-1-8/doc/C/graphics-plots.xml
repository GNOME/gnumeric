  <title>Graphical Plots</title>

  <para>
    &gnum; includes a powerful mechanism
    to create graphical plots which present visually the data contained
    in a worksheet. 
  </para>

  <para>
    The first sub-section of this section starts with an overview of
    graph creation, discusses terminology, and presents graph
    components and their organization. The next sub-section explains
    the <interface>"Graph Guru"</interface> which is the tool used to
    configure graphs. The subsequent  sub-section presents the different
    types of plots which can be included in a graph and the final
    sub-section explains how data can be pre-selected to speed up the
    process of graph creation.
  </para>

  <note>
    <para>
      Graphs are exceedingly effective communication
      devices. Unfortunately, this means that one cannot determine,
      simply based on the data to be plotted, what type of plot will be
      the most effective. Instead users must familiarize themselves with
      the various types of plots which are available and decide for
      themselves which plot type is the most effective to communicate
      an idea. <xref
      linkend="sect-graphics-plots-overview-types" /> contains a
      detailed explanation of the plot types available in
      &gnum;.

	  <para>
	    As explained in <xref
	    linkend="sect-graphics-plots-preselect" />, it is possible
	    to pre-select the data and have gnumeric correctly assign
	    the cell contents into series names, category labels and
	    data values. This process can only be understood once the

      <title>On Terminology</title>

  <note>

    <para>
      The terminology used for describing the components of data
      graphs is confusing because graphs use many components and the
      words are applied arbitrarily to each component. For example,
      the words "graph", "chart", and "plot" could be used
      interchangeably but in &gnum;
      these words are used as explained below.
    </para>

    <para>
      The term 'graph' will be used, in this documentation, to refer
      to the entire graphical element placed on the worksheet. A graph
      has an outline and a background, may have one or more titles,
      and will have at least one 'chart'.
    </para>

    <para>
      The term 'chart' will be used to denote an intermediate level
      element which has an outline and a background, may have one or
      more titles, may have a legend and will have at least one
      'plot'. To support the plot, the chart may have a 'grid' area
      behind the plotted data, and have one or more axes.
    </para>

    <para>
      Each 'plot' will be defined to be of a particular type when it
      is created.  Plots will have one or more 'series' of data values
      which will define the magnitude of the values of to be plotted
      and may define a number of other related values including errors
      in the x and y directions.
    </para>

  </note>

  <para>
    This terminology can be used to describe in detail the components
    of a graph in &gnum;. <xref
    linkend="fig-graph-components" /> presents the components of a
    graph.

          In &gnum;, Graphs are the top
          level element containing all the other components. Graphs
          have two properties related to the style of the background
          rectangular panel, its fill and its outline. Graphs can hold
          one or more titles and one or more charts.
        </para>

        <para>
          Titles have the same properties related to their background
          rectangular panel, the fill and outline, have
          properties related to the text, the font type, style, and
          size, and have the text data that will be the title itself.
        </para>

	<para>
	  Charts have the same properties related to the background
	  rectangular panel and can contain a number of other
	  components including their own titles, a legend, plot
	  accessories and plots.
        </para>

	<para>
	  Legends have the same properties related to their background
	  rectangular panel and also have the properties related to
	  the font in which the name of each series will be added to
	  the legend, the font type, style, and size.
	</para>

	<para>
	  Certain plot types require accessory components such as the
	  elements related to the creation of a Cartesian coordinate
	  system. Charts which include one or more plots of this kind
	  will have a Grid and may have X (horizontal) and Y
	  (vertical) axes.
	</para>

	<para>
	  Grids are the background of Cartesian plots and have the
	  properties determining the fill of this area and the line
	  pattern displayed behind the plotted series.
	</para>

	<para>
	  Axes have properties related to the outer bounds of the
	  axis, the style of the line drawn for the axis, the font
	  style of the markers along the axis, detail properties of
	  the tics and other markers on the axis, and the number
	  format of the axis markers.

	</para>

	<para>
	  Axis labels share the same properties related to the style
	  of their background rectangular panel, including the fill
	  and outline properties, have properties related to the style
	  of the font used for the text, including the font type,
	  style and size, and the data contents of the text used to
	  label the axis.
	</para>

	<para>
	  The properties of each type of plot, and of the data series
	  they contain, vary depending on the actual type of the
	  plot. For instance, the values of a data series which
	  are  plotted as a pie plot will not have any associated
	  error values, whereas values plotted as columns could be
	  associated to Y-error values and values plotted as an XY
	  scatterplot could be associated with error values in both
	  the X and the Y direction. Obviously, these different plot
	  types will require different options. The options associated
	  with each specific plot type will be discussed below, in 
	  <xref linkend="sect-graphics-plots-elementProperties" />.

          <para>

	    Advanced users generally start by pre-selecting at least
            some of the data they will use in their plots. However,
            this step requires a complete understanding graphs and
            this step is not described here. <xref
            linkend="sect-graphics-plots-preselect" /> will explain
            data preselection once the rest of the graphing process

          <title>Launching the Graph Guru</title>
          <para>
            The <interface>Graph guru</interface> can be started in
            two ways. One way to start the <interface>Graph
            Guru</interface> is to click, with the primary mouse
            button, on the toolbar graph button,
            <inlinemediaobject>
              <imageobject>

      	        </phrase>  
              </textobject>
             </inlinemediaobject>. Another way is to select, from the
             <guimenu>Insert</guimenu> menu, the
             <guimenuitem>Chart...</guimenuitem> menu item. Both
             approaches will launch the <interface>Graph Guru</interface>.

          <title>Selecting the plot type, sub-type, and style.</title>

          <para>
            The <interface>Graph guru</interface> opens to the first
            of two panels. The areas of this panel are shown in the
            left hand side of <xref linkend="fig-graphguru-panels"
            />. This panel enables the user to select the type of the
            first plot in the chart, and its sub-type and style. To
            make a graph with multiple plots, a user should start by
            selecting the first plot; subsequent plots can be added
            later. 
          </para>
          
          <procedure>
            <step>
              <title>Picking the plot type</title>
              <para>
                The first area, area <guimenu>A</guimenu>, provides
                a list of the plot types. The user can pick one of
                the types by placing the mouse pointer on top of
                that appropriate entry in the list and clicking the
                primary mouse button. The blue highlight indicates
                which plot type has been chosen. The characteristics
                of the different plot types are explained extensively
                in <xref
                linkend="sect-graphics-plots-overview-types" />. 
              </para>

            <step>
              <title>Picking the plot sub-type and style</title>
              <para>
                The second area of the first panel of the
                <interface>Graph Guru</interface>, labeled
                <guimenu>B</guimenu> in <xref
                linkend="fig-graphguru-panels" />, presents one or
                more icons. The icons presented in this area will
                change depending on what plot type is highlighted in
                area <guimenu>A</guimenu>. The icons provide a way
                to select a sub-type of plot, for example, the icons
                for the column plot type provide the choice between
                plotting columns of each data series side-by-side or
                plotting these columns stacked upon each other.
                These icons may also provide a way to quickly select
                different styles for the plot type, for example the
                icons for the line type provide a choice between
                plotting a simple line or placing markers at the
                points along the line. The sub-type cannot be
                changed in the next panel of the <interface>Graph
                Guru</interface> without deleting the plot and
                creating a new one. However, the style choices can
                be altered in the next panel. The meaning of each of
                these icons is explained in <xref
                linkend="sect-graphics-plots-overview-types" />
                below grouped by plot type. If data has been
                pre-selected, clicking on the <guibutton>Show
                Sample</guibutton> will present a preview of the plot
                type in area <guimenu>B</guimenu>.
              </para>
            </step>
            <step>
              <title>Moving to the next panel</title>
              <para>
                Once a plot type has been chosen in area
                <guimenu>A</guimenu> and an icon selected in area
                <guimenu>B</guimenu>, the first panel has been
                completed. Clicking on the
                <guibutton>Forward</guibutton> button will dismiss
                the first panel of the <interface>Graph
                Guru</interface> and bring up the second panel.

        <step>
          <title>Configuring the plot</title>
          <para>
            The second panel of the <interface>Graph Guru</interface>
            enables users to configure the plot. This includes
            determining the values which will actually be plotted,
            adding titles to various components, labels to the data
            series, names to data categories, and changing the
            appearance of the different components.
          </para>

          <para>
            The simplest way both to learn the hierarchy of components
            in &gnum; graphs and to
            understand the properties which can be changed for each
            component is to work sequentially through all of the
            components while both noting the components which can be
            added, listed in the drop down menu when the
            <guibutton>Add</guibutton> button is pressed, and
            observing the properties of the component which can be
            altered, shown in the lower part of the panel, the area
            labeled <guimenu>J</guimenu> in <xref
            linkend="fig-graphguru-panels" />. Each component in the
            hierarchy can be selected in turn using the complete tree
            of all the components presented in the top leftmost area,
            labeled <guimenu>F</guimenu>. Components can be selected
            by placing the mouse pointer over their name in this tree
            and then clicking with the primary mouse button. The
            currently selected component is indicated by the blue
            highlight on that line. Changing the selected component
            will also change the properties listed in area
            <guimenu>J</guimenu>. Tree nodes, indicated by arrowheads
            in front of the name of a component, can be expanded or
            collapsed with alternative mouse clicks.
          </para>

          <para>
            The second panel of the <interface>Graph Guru</interface>
            only allows two types of actions to be performed: the
            hierarchy of component elements can be modified or the
            properties of an element can be altered.

        value in the series, for example, the second data value taken
        from each series all share one category. The data values are
        plotted along the vertical (Y) axis according to their numeric
        value and the particular sub-type chosen for the line plot.
      </para>

      <para>
        Line plot sub-types provide three options for relating the
        values from different data series. The first sub-type plots
        each series independently with the data value determining the
        vertical distance between each point and the horizontal
        axis. The second sub-type plots the series stacked on each
        other in a cumulative fashion with the data value of each
        series determining the vertical distance from the point to the
        sum of the values in all the previous series. For example, if
        the first series starts with values 
	<literal>{3.9, 4.2, ...}</literal>, the second
        series with values 
        <literal>{1.2, 3.5, ...}</literal>, and the
        third series with values 
	<literal>{3.1, 1.9, ...}</literal>, then the
        point value for the second element of the third series will be
        plotted at 9.6 
	(<literal>9.6=4.2+3.5+1.9</literal>) along
        the vertical axis. The third sub-type plots each series based
        on the proportional contribution of the value to the total of
        all values in that category. Using the example above, the
        three values would be plotted at 0.4375, 0.8020, and 1 because
        the intervals between zero and each of these numbers is
        <literal>0.4375=4.2/(4.2+3.5+1.9)</literal>
        for the first, 
	<literal>0.3645...=3.5/(4.2+3.5+1.9)</literal> for the
        second, and 
        <literal>0.1979...=1.9/(4.2+3.5+1.9)</literal> 
	for the third, although, by default, these numbers are
        presented as percentages on the vertical (Y) axis.
      </para>

      <para>
        Two styles are available by default for line plots. In the
        first no markers are placed on the value of the point whereas
        in the second a point marker is added wherever the points are
        plotted.

	                This screenshot shows a table of data and three
                        line plots. The data consist of three series
                        organized by row and starting with the words
                        "Widgets", "Gadgets", and "Lumpets". Each of
                        these series has values in five categories. The
                        three graphs illustrate the three sub-types of
                        line plots, with the series plotted
                        independently in the left plot, stacked in the
                        middle plot, and proportionately stacked in the
                        right plot.

      <para>
        Each series in line plots can include three main elements and
        two error elements, although only the value element is
        necessary. The series can have a 'Name' element, which is a
        single text entry used to identify the series, must have a
        'Values' element, which is a sequence of numeric values, and
        may have a 'Label' element, which is a sequence of text
        entries used to identify the categories.  All of these
        elements can be defined as references to a region of the
        worksheet, as literally defined entries, or as formula
        expressions which result in the correct type. The 'Label'
        element is shared by all of the series. The legend added to a
        line plot identifies the different series, by default using
        the entries of the 'Name' element of each series. The two
        error elements include a list for errors in the positive
        direction and one for errors in the negative direction.

        The data values from three series of equal length are plotted
	on the Cartesian (X-Y) plane, the value from the first series
	determining the position of the plotted symbol center along
	the X axis, the value from the second series determining the
	position of the plotted symbol center along the Y axis, and
	the value of the third series determining the radius of the
	circle plotted. Each triplet of series can be plotted with
	different symbols but the data values of any series can be
	shared.

        Each series in a bubble plot can include four main components
        and four optional error components. The series may have a
        name, a single text value which will identify the series in
        the graph guru and in any legend attached to the chart. The
        series must have two lists of quantitative values, a list of X
        values and a list of Y values, which must have an equal number
        of elements. The series must also have a list, with the same
        number of elements, whose values will determine the size of
        the circles drawn at each point. The series may have lists of
        error components for the X values or the Y values and for
        positive or negative errors.

        Pie plots present the numeric values from a single series of
        categorical data as slices of a circular area, the angular
        arc of each slice determined by the proportional magnitude of
        each value compared to the overall sum of all the values. For
        example, if the series had values { 1.12, 4.48, 3.36, 1.68,
        0.56}, the contribution of each slice to the total would be
	{0.10, 0.40, 0.330, 0.15, 0.0 5}, since 
	<literal>0.10= 1.12/(1.12+4.48+3.36+1.68+0.56)</literal>, and
        the angular arcs of the wedges would be

        Pie plot styles provide two choices for the rendering of the
        pie chart, either with all slices linked into one overall
        circle, or with gaps between the slices. The size of the gap
        is a property of the pie plot which can be changed.

        Each pie plot contains a single series which can include three
        elements although only the value element is necessary. The
        series can have a 'Name' element, which is a single text entry
        used to identify the series, must have a 'Values' element,
        which is a sequence of numeric values, and may have a 'Label'
        element, which is a sequence of text entries used to identify
        the categories. All of these elements can be defined as
        references to a region of the worksheet, as literally defined
        entries, or as formula expressions which result in the correct
        type. The legend added to a pie plot identifies the different
        categories using the entries in the 'Label' element.

      </title>

      <para>
        Area plots present the numeric values of categorical data with
        the data values of each series connected by a line and the
        area below the line shaded. This type is directly analogous to
        the line plot type. Sequential data values are considered to
        belong to different categories and are plotted along the
        horizontal axis at equally spaced intervals. The data
        values from different series are assigned to these categories
        based on the position of the value in the series, for example,
        the second data value taken from each series all share one
        category. The data values are plotted along the vertical (Y)
        axis according to their numeric value and the particular
        sub-type chosen for the area plot.
      </para>

      <para>
        Area plot sub-types provide three options for relating the
        values from different data series. The first sub-type plots
        each series independently with the data value determining the
        vertical distance between each point and the horizontal
        axis. The second sub-type plots the series stacked on each
        other in a cumulative fashion with the data value of each
        series determining the vertical distance from the point to the
        sum of the values in all the previous series. For example, if
        the first series starts with values 
	<literal>{3.9, 4.2, ...}</literal>, the second
        series with values 
        <literal>{1.2, 3.5, ...}</literal>, and the
        third series with values 
	<literal>{3.1, 1.9, ...}</literal>, then the
        point value for the second element of the third series will be
        plotted at 9.6 
	(since <literal>9.6=4.2+3.5+1.9</literal>) along
        the vertical axis. The third sub-type plots each series based
        on the proportional contribution of the value to the total of
        all values in that category. Using the example above, the
        three values would be plotted at 0.4375, 0.8020, and 1 because
        the intervals between zero and each of these numbers is
        <literal>0.4375=4.2/(4.2+3.5+1.9)</literal>
        for the first, 
	<literal>0.3645...=3.5/(4.2+3.5+1.9)</literal> for the
        second, and 
        <literal>0.1979...=1.9/(4.2+3.5+1.9)</literal> 
	for the third, although, by default, these numbers are
        presented as percentages on the vertical (Y) axis.
      </para>

        Area plots do not have any pre-defined styles.

	                This screenshot shows a table of data and three
                        area plots. The data consist of three series
                        organized by row and starting with the words
                        "Widgets", "Gadgets", and "Lumpets". Each of
                        these series has values in five categories. The
                        three graphs illustrate the three sub-types of
                        area plots, with the series plotted
                        independently in the left plot, stacked in the
                        middle plot, and proportionately stacked in the
                        right plot.

      <para>
        Each series in area plots can include three main elements and
        two error elements, although only the value element is
        necessary. The series can have a 'Name' element, which is a
        single text entry used to identify the series, must have a
        'Values' element, which is a sequence of numeric values, and
        may have a 'Label' element, which is a sequence of text
        entries used to identify the categories.  All of these
        elements can be defined as references to a region of the
        worksheet, as literally defined entries, or as formula
        expressions which result in the correct type. The 'Label'
        element is shared by all of the series. The legend added to an
        area plot identifies the different series, by default using
        the entries of the 'Name' element of each series. The two
        error elements include a list for errors in the positive
        direction and one for errors in the negative direction.

      <para>
        Bar plots present the numeric values of categorical data with
        the data values of each series represented as a horizontal
        bar. Sequential data values are considered to belong to
        different categories and are plotted along the vertical
        axis at equally spaced intervals. The data values from
        different series are assigned to these categories based on the
        position of the value in the series, for example, the second
        data value taken from each series all share one category. The
        data values are plotted along the horizontal (X) axis as bars
        of different lengths and positions depending on the numeric
        content of the data value and the particular sub-type
        chosen for the bar plot.
      </para>

      <para>
        Bar plot sub-types provide three options for relating the
        values from different data series. The first sub-type plots
        each series independently in adjacent bars, each of which is
        tied to the vertical axis and has its length determined by the
        numeric content of the data value. The second sub-type plots
        each series as a horizontally stacked set of bars with the
        horizontal length of each element determined by the numeric
        content of the data value and the position of the bar
        determined by the position of the element in the data
        series. For example, if the first series starts with values
	<literal>{3.9, 4.2, ...}</literal>, the second
        series with values 
        <literal>{1.2, 3.5, ...}</literal>, and the
        third series with values 
	<literal>{3.1, 1.9, ...}</literal>, then the third bar will be
        plotted ranging from 7.7 to 9.6, since 
	<literal>7.7=4.2+3.5</literal> and 
	<literal>9.6=4.2+3.5+1.9</literal>. The third sub-type plots
        each series as a horizontally stacked set of bars scaled to
        the total all the numeric values in that category. Using the
        example above, the three bars would range from 0 to 0.4375,
        from 0.4375 to 0.8020, and from 0.8020 to 1 respectively
        because the intervals are the proportional contribution of
        each data value to the total, i.e.
        <literal>0.4375=4.2/(4.2+3.5+1.9)</literal>
        for the first, 
	<literal>0.3645...=3.5/(4.2+3.5+1.9)</literal> for the
        second, and 
        <literal>0.1979...=1.9/(4.2+3.5+1.9)</literal> 
	for the third. By default, these numbers are
        presented as percentages on the horizontal (X) axis.

        Bar plots do not have any pre-defined styles.

        series. For example, if the first series starts with values
	<literal>{3.9, 4.2, ...}</literal>, the second
        series with values 
        <literal>{1.2, 3.5, ...}</literal>, and the
        third series with values 
	<literal>{3.1, 1.9, ...}</literal>, then the third column will be
        plotted ranging from 7.7 to 9.6, since 
	<literal>7.7=4.2+3.5</literal> and 
	<literal>9.6=4.2+3.5+1.9</literal>. The third sub-type plots
        each series as a vertically stacked set of columns scaled to
        the total all the numeric values in that category. Using the
        example above, the three columns would range from 0 to 0.4375,
        from 0.4375 to 0.8020, and from 0.8020 to 1 respectively
        because the intervals are the proportional contribution of
        each data value to the total, i.e.
        <literal>0.4375=4.2/(4.2+3.5+1.9)</literal>
        for the first, 
	<literal>0.3645...=3.5/(4.2+3.5+1.9)</literal> for the
        second, and 
        <literal>0.1979...=1.9/(4.2+3.5+1.9)</literal> 
	for the third. By default, these numbers are
        presented as percentages on the vertical (Y) axis.

        Each series in column plots can include three main elements
        and two error elements, although only the value element is
        necessary. The series can have a 'Name' element, which is a
        single text entry used to identify the series, must have a
        'Values' element, which is a sequence of numeric values, and
        may have a 'Label' element, which is a sequence of text
        entries used to identify the categories.  All of these
        elements can be defined as references to a region of the
        worksheet, as literally defined entries, or as formula
        expressions which result in the correct type. The 'Label'
        element is shared by all of the series. The legend added to a
        column plot identifies the different series, by default using
        the entries of the 'Name' element of each series. The two
        error elements include a list for errors in the positive
        direction and one for errors in the negative direction.

      <para>
        Radar plots present the numeric values of categorical data as
        a set of points plotted along a set of axes radiating from a
        central point, with as many axes as there are values in the
        series and with the points connected by a line, possibly with
        the interior of the shape filled in. Sequential data values
        are considered to belong to different categories and are
        plotted on separate axes which are not necessarily orthogonal
        and radiate from a central point. Sequential points are
        connected by a line with the final point connected back to the
        first to form a closed polygon. The data values from different
        series are assigned to categories based on the position of the
        value in the series, for example, the second data value taken
        from each series all share one category and will therefore all
        be plotted on the same axis.  The data values are plotted
        along the axis of each class according to their numeric value.

      <para>
        Radar plots do not have any sub-types.

      <para>
        Radar plot styles provide three choices for the rendering of the
        chart. The first style presents the radar chart as only a polygon of
        lines. The second style also includes a marker where the data
        values are plotted on each axis. The third style plots the
        radar chart as a filled polygon.

      <para>
        Ring plots present the numeric values of categorical data as
        segments of circular rings. Sequential data values are
        considered to belong to different categories and are plotted
        with distinct patterns. The data values from different series
        are assigned to these categories based on the position of the
        value in the series, for example, the second data value taken
        from each series all share one category. The data values are
        used to determine the size of the arc based on the
        proportionate size of the data value to the sum of all data
        values in the series. For
        example, if the series had values { 1.12, 4.48, 3.36, 1.68,
        0.56}, the contribution of each ring section to the total would be
	{0.10, 0.40, 0.330, 0.15, 0.0 5}, since

        Ring plot styles provide two choices. Ring plots can be
        plotted with all segments linked into a single overall ring,
        with different series plotted immediately adjacent to one
        another in sequentially larger rings. Alternatively, the
        segments of the outermost ring can be split and float a
        certain distance away from the next ring.

	                This screenshot shows a table of data and two
                        ring plots. The data consist of a single data
                        series organized in a row and starting with the
                        word "Widgets". The data consist of three series
                        organized by row and starting with the words
                        "Widgets", "Gadgets", and "Lumpets". Each of
                        these series has values in five categories. The
                        two graphs illustrate the two sub-types of ring
                        plots, the left most plot without any gaps and
                        the right most plot having the outer plot with
                        gaps.

      <para>
        Each series in ring plots can include three main elements and
        two error elements, although only the value element is
        necessary. The series can have a 'Name' element, which is a
        single text entry used to identify the series, must have a
        'Values' element, which is a sequence of numeric values, and
        may have a 'Label' element, which is a sequence of text
        entries used to identify the categories.  All of these
        elements can be defined as references to a region of the
        worksheet, as literally defined entries, or as formula
        expressions which result in the correct type. The 'Label'
        element is shared by all of the series. The legend added to a
        ring plot identifies the different series, by default using
        the entries of the 'Name' element of each series. The two
        error elements include a list for errors in the positive
        direction and one for errors in the negative direction.

      <title>Axes</title>

      <para>
        Axes are used in several different kinds of plots to provide
        quantitative indexes for the scale of each plot
        direction. &gnum; uses four
        different kinds of axes. <guilabel>Category</guilabel> axes do
        not provide a quantitative scale but merely distinguish each
        different category by providing space for the values of the
        category along the axis. <guilabel>Continuous</guilabel> axes
        provide a quantitative measure of each value based on the
        projection of that value onto the
        axis. <guilabel>Radial</guilabel> axes are used in radar plots
        and are continuous axes which radiate from a central
        point. <guilabel>Circular</guilabel> axes have not yet been
        implemented.
      </para>

      <para>
        Line, column and area charts use a category axis to separate
        the categories along the horizontal direction and a continuous
        axis to distinguish values in the vertical direction. Bar
        charts reverse these two axes. XY scatter plots and bubble
        plots use two continuous axes, one in the horizontal
        direction, the X-axis, and one in the vertical direction, the
        Y-axis. Radar plots use three or more continuous axes
        radiating from a central point. Pie and Ring plots do not use
        any axes.

        Each plot will have one or more 'series' which organize the
        data values. Each series element has a number of
        properties. The element will have a <guilabel>Style</guilabel>
        tab with which the style of the line and point markers, or the
        area and outline can be set. Each series element will have a
        <guilabel>Data</guilabel> tab in which the name of the series,
        the values used for the series and any labels associated with
        these values can be entered. The data values will generally be
        entered as references to cells on a worksheet which will allow
        the plots to be automatically altered when the values in the
        worksheet change. The series may also have one or more
        <guilabel>Error</guilabel> tabs in which error values can be
        associated to the data value of each element in the series.
