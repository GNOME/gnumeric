  &gnum; is a spreadsheet, a computer
  program used to manipulate and analyze numeric
  data. &gnum; can help you keep track of
  information in lists, organize numeric values in columns and rows,
  perform and update complex calculations by defining each step of the
  calculation and modifying particular steps subsequently, create and
  display or print graphical plots of data using bar plots, line
  graphs, pie charts or radar charts, implement complex optimization
  modeling or perform many other tasks involving numbers, dates,
  times, names or other data.

  <para>
    Releases of &gnum; in the 1.8 series have numbers starting
    with 1.8 but with extra numbers afterwards, such as 1.8.0 or
    1.8.3. These are stable releases which are only changed with minor
    improvements and fixes for problems (bugs) in the program. These
    releases can be considered safe for use in a production
    environment.

    The 1.9 series of releases are unstable releases meant for

        Transparent access and manipulation of files from other

        compressed XML which can be decompressed using
        <application>gunzip</application>, the GNU
        <application>gzip</application> program's decompression utility, into
        text. &gnum; can open files from
        several well known proprietary and free spreadsheets including
        MS Excel<trademark/>, Lotus 1-2-3<trademark/>,

        <markup>\longtable</markup>, HTML, and roff
        files. &gnum; also benefits from
        a highly configurable text importer and exporter which ensures
        that data can be transferred smoothly, and allows new formats
        to be added easily as plug-in software routines.

        &gnum; now has enough of the
        features that users expect in a spreadsheet to provide for the
        vast majority of user needs. However, new features are
        constantly being added. People often quote the statistic that
        most users only need 20% of the features of the software they
        use. This statistic does not mean that only 20% of the
        features are needed but, rather, that most users share a
        common need for 10% of the features and require distinct
        features for the rest of their
        work. &gnum; attempts to provide
        full implementations of the features it offers, leaving
        features unimplemented until a robust and complete

        &gnum; is <ulink type="http"
        url="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free
        software</ulink> in the sense of giving its users several
        freedoms related to the program including the freedoms to use,
        modify and redistribute the program. These freedoms are
        explained at the <ulink type="http"

        site page on the <ulink type="http"

        for everyone, certain restrictions are required which prevent
        anyone limiting these freedom for others.
        &gnum; is therefore released

        One of the consequences of these freedoms, is that everyone
        can have access to the source code used to create
        &gnum;. This code is explicitly
        maintained and documented to make it easy for anyone to modify
        in any way they choose. This makes it possible to modify the

  The &gnum; 1.9 series of releases are
  developer releases. These releases are kept as stable as
  possible. However, each release in this series includes changes and
  improvements some of which are quite large. These new changes may
  cause the program to crash and loose data. Do not use these releases
  if you cannot afford to loose any data or work. However, these
  releases include many new features that can be helpful. If you use
  this series, backup your data often, not just by saving files but by
  renaming them and checking that they can be reopened. If you
  experience mistakes or crashes while you are using this version,
  please report these using the GNOME project's bug reporting
