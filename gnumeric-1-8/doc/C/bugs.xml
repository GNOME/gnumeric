  <title>Overview</title>

  <para>
    &gnum; is a complex computer program
    and therefore necessarily contains some mistakes. The
    &gnum; team is keenly interested in
    finding these errors and correcting them. Suggestions for
    improvement are also welcome and can be submitted in the same
    fashion as an error report.
  </para>

  <para>
    <emphasis>
      Please, help us to fix any errors by telling us about them.
    </emphasis>
  </para>

  <para>
    Reports of problems with &gnum;
    provide the project with a way of making sure that the mistake is
    eventually fixed. Often the mistake is obvious and a fix can be
    made immediately to be included in the very next release of
    &gnum;. Occasionally, the mistake is
    more complex and the problem may take a while to be resolved. In
    these cases, the report provides a way to remind the developers that
    the problem still exists.
  </para>

  <note>
    <para>
      Mistakes in programs are often called "bugs" after one of the
      earliest errors in an old machine which was actually caused
      by an insect entering the machine and preventing a switch from
      closing.
    </para>
  </note>

  <para>
    The &gnum; project uses a world wide
    web system called <application>Bugzilla</application> to collect
    reports of program errors and then to track these errors until
    they are finally fixed. The system was developed as part of the
    <application>Mozilla</application> web browser project, which
    explains the origin of the strange name.
  </para>

  <para>
    The process of submitting the report of a problem or of a
    suggested enhancement is quite simple and can be completed in just
    a few steps. The process begins with obtaining a good
    understanding of the problem to be able to provide a detailed
    statement explaining the problem exactly. Next, the user must open
    an account with the GNOME project's
    <application>Bugzilla</application> system. Finally, the user must
    submit the statement of the problem, ideally, along with some
    information about the computer setup being used by the person
    experiencing the problem.
  </para>

  <para>
    The explanation given below should be sufficient to file a
    report. For more detailed
    instructions, the main page of GNOME's bugzilla can be found at
    <ulink type="http" url="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/">
      <uri>http://bugzilla.gnome.org/</uri>
    </ulink> and instructions can be found at 
    <ulink type="http" url="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/bug-HOWTO.html">

  <sect1 id="sect-bugs-understand">
    <title>Defining the error</title>

    <para>
      The most critical step is understanding the error as well as
      possible. This requires knowing clearly what was happening
      before the error occurred, what specifically caused the error to
      occur, what the error condition is and what happened as a
      consequence of the error.
    </para>

    <para>
      The most helpful situation to enable the developers to find and
      correct the error is to come up with a sequence of steps that
      generate the error. If the error can be repeated, it can almost
      always be corrected. The most helpful error reports include a
      small recipe that can cause the error to occur.
    </para>

<sect1 id="sect-bugs-bugzilla_account">
  <title>Opening an account</title>

    <para>
      The first time a user uses <application>Bugzilla</application>,
      they must create an account. This account is needed to allow
      users to be informed of the status of the bug as it is tracked
      by the system from submission to resolution. The only
      requirement for opening a <application>Bugzilla</application>
      account is the possession of a valid email address through which
      the user can receive a password.
    </para>

  <sect2 id="sect-bugs-bugzilla_account-create">
    <title>Creating a new account</title>

    <para>
      Users of <application>Bugzilla</application> are automatically
      redirected to a login page, unless they have previously logged
      into the system and accepted a 'cookie' with which they identify
      themselves. The login page has a link called "Create a new
      account" which will direct users to the account creation page.
    </para>

    <para>
      Alternatively, by clicking on this <ulink type="http"
      url="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/createaccount.cgi">link</ulink>,
      users can follow a shortcut directly to the account creation
      page.
    </para>

    <para>
      Creating a new account is very simple. The account creation page
      has two fields. In the first, a valid email account must be
      given. The second asks for a name by which the user wishes to be
      known. After a user fills out these two fields, clicking on the
      button labeled "Create Account" will cause a new account to be
      created and an email sent to the address given in the email
      field. The email will contain the password used to identify this
      user.
    </para>

  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="sect-bugs-bugzilla_account-login">
    <title>Logging into the account</title>

    <para>
      After creating an account, users can visit the bug entry
      <ulink type="http" 
      url="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Gnumeric">page
      </ulink>
      for &gnum;. Here
      users are asked to login with their email address and
      password. After logging in, <application>Bugzilla</application>
      will present a page to add a bug report.
   </para>

   <note>
     <para>
       A user who accepts cookies from <literal>bugzilla.gnome.org</literal>
       will only have to give a password the first time they visit
       GNOME's <application>Bugzilla</application>. During all future
       visits, GNOME will recognize the cookie and thereby identify
       the user.

<sect1 id="sect-bugs-report">
  <title>Filing a report</title>

    <warning>
      <para>
        In order to file a report of a problem with
        &gnum;, a
        <application>Bugzilla</application> account is
        necessary. Please see the previous section, <xref
        linkend="sect-bugs-bugzilla_account" />, for an explanation of
        how to open an account.
      </para>
    </warning>

    <para>
      The &gnum; bug entry page consists
      of several fields many of which must be filled out to provide a
      useful bug report. The most important of these will be the "Bug
      Description" which contains both the brief "Summary" field which
      acts like an email subject line and the detailed description
      field "Step to reproduce the bug" which should be used to give a
      more complete explanation of the problem and, ideally, to
      describe step by step how to reproduce the bug. The only other
      field which is required is the "Component" field which can be
      set to "General" and left to the developers to define more
      specifically. The remaining fields can be helpful, since they
      provide extra information which may help resolve the problem, but
      are not necessary. After filling out these three fields, a user
      can, if they desire, simply skip to the bottom and press the
      <guibutton>Commit</guibutton> button.
    </para>

  <sect2 id="sect-bugs-bugzilla_access">
    <title>Accessing the GNOME project's Bugzilla</title>

    <para>
      There are several ways to file a bug report through
      <application>Bugzilla</application>.
    </para>

    <para>
       One of the entries in the <guimenu>Help</guimenu> menu is
      called <guimenuitem>Report a Problem</guimenuitem>. This menu
      entry should cause a browser window to launch and open
      <application>Bugzilla</application> to the
      &gnum; page.
    </para>

    <para>
      Alternatively, users can click on this <ulink type="http"
      url="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Gnumeric">
      link</ulink> to access the &gnum;
      page in <application>Bugzilla</application>.
    </para>

    <para>
      If neither of those shortcuts work, the user must use a web
      browser to access the following location:
<screen>http://bugzilla.gnome.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Gnumeric
</screen>
      The simplest way would be to use the mouse to copy the text and
      paste that text into the location bar of a web browser.
    </para>

    <para>
      The user may be asked to login, by giving their account name and
      their password, when they begin their browser session with
      <application>Bugzilla</application>. See <xref
      linkend="sect-bugs-bugzilla_account-login" /> for an explanation
      of how to login to <application>Bugzilla</application>.
    </para>

  </sect2>


    <sect2 id="sect-bugs-report-description">
      <title>The Bug Description</title>

      <para>
        A useful error report will include a subject that describes
        the error concisely, has a brief introduction which explains
        in greater detail what happened and, ideally, has a small
        recipe that leads to the error being repeated.
      </para>

      <para>
        The summary field, like the subject of an email message,
        briefly describes the problem. For example, a useful error
        report might have a summary "Gnumeric crashes when saving a
        file".
      </para>

      <para>
        The field titled "Steps to reproduce the bug" should contain a
        slightly expanded version of the summary giving an overview of
        the problem and then give a step-by-step example of how to
        reproduce the problem. For example, this field could look like
        the following: 
<screen> 
This report describes an error which causes Gnumeric to crash
during the use of the file save dialog.

1) Start a new Gnumeric
2) In Cell A1 type "hello"
3) From the "File" menu, select "Save As"
=> The "Save As dialog" opens up
4) In the file name box, type "my_spreadsheet.gnumeric"
5) Click on the "Save" button
=> I expected the file to be saved, and to be able to keep
working but instead Gnumeric disappeared and the file was 
never saved.

    <sect2 id="sect-bugs-report-severity">
      <title>The Severity and Priority of the Problem</title>

      <para>
        The severity level indicates the seriousness of the problem
        and the priority level indicates the desire of the developers
        to address the bug. These fields are used mostly by the
        developers and should both be left as "normal" unless the user
        has a good reason to change them.
      </para>

      <para>
        There are two cases when the user should change the severity
	of the report. In the first case, if the user has a problem
	which causes &gnum; to crash (to
	suddenly disappear or stop working) or a problem in which data
	is lost, the severity should be set to "critical". In the
	second case, if the user has a report about a desired feature,
	the severity should be set to "enhancement" so the developers
	will know right away that the desired functionality has not
	yet been added to the program.

	the most recent version number should be used. The version
	number can be obtained by opening the <interface>"About
