      Each of these approaches will save the file directly, allowing
      no intervention on the part the user. If the file has been newly
      created, &gnum; will automatically launch the <interface>Save

      other configuration options for the file, as is explained below.

    <title>Using the <interface>File Save</interface> dialog.</title>

    <para>
      Saving a workbook to a file can be a simple process, depending
      on the folder in which the file is to be saved. If this folder
      is in the predefined list of standard folders and user bookmark
      folders, the file can be created with the compact
      <interface>File Save</interface> dialog. The components of the
      compact <interface>File Save</interface> dialog and the
      procedure to save a workbook to a file in the predefined list of
      folders are explained next.

    </para>

    <para>
      However, when the workbook is to be saved to a file created in a
      folder which is not in the preselected list, the expanded
      <interface>File Save</interface> dialog will be required. The
      components of the expanded <interface>File Save</interface>
      dialog, the procedure for saving files in a different folder,
      and an explanation of bookmark folders and their use are given
      further below.

      <para>
        The <interface>File Save</interface> dialog allows the user to
        save a workbook into a new file but requires that the user
        provide a name for the file, select the folder in which to
        save the file, and select a file format type to use for this
        file. This dialog also provides a way to navigate the folder
        hierarchy as will be explained further below.

        The default action, if a user simply opens the <interface>File

          <para>
            Both methods will launch the <interface>File

            open automatically the first time a new workbook is saved.
          </para>


	</step>

        <step>
	  <title>
	    Select a name for the file.
	  </title>
	  <para>
	    Next, a name must be given for the file. &gnum; provides a
	    default name but, when the dialog is first opened this
	    name is highlighted indicating that it is already
	    selected. Therefore, a user can simply start typing a new
	    name and the first character entered will delete the name
	    given by default. The file name field is presented as area

	    Using this list requires placing the mouse pointer above

	    to open the list. The desired folder can then be selected
	    by moving the pointer down the list and clicking again
	    with the primary mouse button. The second click will close
	    the drop down list and change the selected folder. Instead
	    of the two mouse clicks, the entire operation can be
	    replaced by a click-hold, drag and release, where the
	    first mouse click is replaced by the click-and-hold and
	    the second mouse click is replaced by the release.

	    created, and the list of bookmark folders available can

	    <listitem>
	      <para>
	        This area allows the user to select the starting
	        folder from which to navigate the folder
	        hierarchy. The navigation system only allows users to
	        select sub-folders of the currently selected 'relative
	        root' folder so the root folder selected in area
	        <emphasis role="bold">F</emphasis> must contain the
	        desired folder as a sub-folder.
	      </para>

	      <para>
	        The folders listed in this area include the standard
	        folders provided by the system and a number of folders
	        added, as bookmark folders, by the user. The standard folders
	        provided by the system will vary for different
	        machines and system administrators may have disabled
	        access to certain areas. By default, the standard
	        folders provided include the user's 'Home' folder, the
	        user's 'Desktop' folder, a folder pointing to the root
	        of the filesystem tree and folders for each of the
	        removable storage devices attached to the
	        computer. The user's home folder, on GNU and other
	        UNIX like systems, this
	        folder is usually known as <literal>~</literal> or
	        <literal>~user_account_name</literal> where the
	        phrase <literal>user_account_name</literal>
	        represents the account name used by the current
	        user. This folder is often located at
	        <filename>/home/user_account_name/</filename> in the
	        filesystem. The 'Desktop' folder is the folder which
	        holds the files which are displayed in the background
	        of the user's window. The 'Filesystem' folder is the
	        top of the filesystem tree, which on GNU systems is
	        also known as <filename>/</filename>. The list also
	        presents peripheral or external devices. Below the
	        standard folders, area <emphasis
	        role="bold">F</emphasis> has a separator and the
	        bookmark folders selected by the user. In <xref
	        linkend="fig-file-save-dialog-expanded-components"
	        /> the folder <filename>currentWork</filename> is a

        Changing the currently selected folder.
      </title>

      <para>
        In order to save a file in a folder other than that provided
        by default, it is necessary to change the default folder. The
        note below explains briefly the notion of folders and the
        procedure further down explains how to change folders.
      </para>

      <note>
        <title>Understanding the file organization system.</title>

        <para>
	  In order to understand how to change folders, it is first
	  necessary to understand the system by which documents are
	  stored. This system is called the 'filesystem'.
	</para>

	<para>
	  All documents are stored in a folder. Folders can contain
	  files but can also contain other folders. Any folder
	  therefore can contain several sub-folders, each of which may
	  itself contain several sub-folders; the resulting structure
	  is called a nested 'tree' with the original folder being the
	  'relative root' of that tree.
        </para>

	<para>
	  In GNU and UNIX systems, all of the files are stored in
	  folders organized in a single, unified filesystem tree with
	  a folder named '<filename>/</filename>' at the absolute root
	  of the tree. Every file is accessible from this absolute
	  root folder and, by default, this folder is provided as the
	  choice named <filename>Filesystem</filename> with an icon of
	  a disk drive in area <emphasis role="bold">F</emphasis> in
	  the <interface>File Save</interface> dialog.
	</para>

	<para>
	  Navigating the directory tree from the single root folder
	  would quickly become burdensome and the <interface>File
	  Save</interface> dialog provides several other starting
	  points in area <emphasis role="bold">F</emphasis>. These
	  will be called, in this documentation, the 'relative root'
	  folders since each of these will act as the root of the
	  branching structure of sub-folders the relative root folder
	  contains. Two relative root folders which are commonly
	  provided are the 'Home' and 'Desktop' folders for the
	  current user.
	</para>

	<para>
	  In a complex computer system, the absolute root folder may
	  be hidden from the user and only 'relative roots' will be
	  present. These should jointly provide some way to access all
	  the areas where the user can save files.
	</para>

	<para>
	  The 'relative roots' are also necessary when several file
	  systems are available to the user. This will be the case
	  when filesystem on other machines are accessible over a
	  network or when &gnum; is running on operating systems whose
	  filesystems are not unified, such as the proprietary
	  operating systems sold by Microsoft in which each disk drive
	  has its own root named, for example,
	  <filename>C:\</filename> or <filename>D:\</filename>.
	</para>
	  
	<para>
	  Additional 'relative root' folders can be added as 'bookmark
	  folders' by the users themselves. These bookmark folders can
	  be used to access quickly folders which are commonly
	  used. The bookmark folders are listed, in area <emphasis
	  role="bold">F</emphasis>, under the thin horizontal
	  separator line. The creation and deletion of these bookmark
	  folders is explained below, in <xref
	  linkend="sect-file-save-dialog-bookmarks" />.
	</para>

	<para>
	  

	</para>
      </note>

      <para>
        Changing folders involves selecting a 'relative root' folder,
        then navigating into the appropriate sub-folder. When the
        <guibutton>Save</guibutton> button is pressed, the file will be
        saved in the folder listed as the right most button in area
        <emphasis role="bold">G</emphasis> of <xref
        linkend="fig-file-save-dialog-expanded-components" />
        which also means that the file will be saved alongside the
        folders and files listed in area <emphasis
        role="bold">I</emphasis>.
     </para>

      <procedure>
        <title>
	  The procedure to change the currently selected folder.
	</title>

	<para>
	  To select a new folder, one of the 'relative root' folders
	  which contains the desired folder must first be selected and
	  then the hierarchy must be navigated to find the desired
	  folder. As explained below, a user can move around the
	  hierarchy using as many changes as they need to choose the
	  folder in which to save their &gnum; file.
	</para>

        <step>
	  <title>
	    Select a 'relative-root' folder in area <emphasis
	    role="bold">F</emphasis>. 
	  </title>
	  <para>
	    The first step in choosing a new folder requires
	    selecting, in area <emphasis role="bold">F</emphasis>, a
	    'relative root' folder which contains the desired
	    folder. The new 'relative root' folder is chosen by placing the
	    mouse pointer over the folder name and double clicking
	    (click twice rapidly without moving the mouse) with the
	    primary mouse button. This will change the leftmost button
	    in  area <emphasis role="bold">G</emphasis> and change the
	    folders and files listed in  area <emphasis
	    role="bold">I</emphasis>.
	  </para>
	</step>

        <step>
	  <title>
	    Navigate the filesystem to reach the desired
	    folder using area <emphasis role="bold">I</emphasis>.
	  </title>
	  <para>
	    The next step involves descending the folder tree to reach
	    the desired folder. This requires double clicking the
	    sub-folder of the 'relative root' folder which contains
	    the desired folder and continuing through the whole
	    hierarchy until the desired folder is reached. After each
	    double click, the selected folder is added as the right
	    most button in area <emphasis role="bold">G</emphasis> and
	    the contents of the selected folder are shown in area
	    <emphasis role="bold">I</emphasis>. Once the desired
	    folder is reached, it must be opened in the same way, so
	    that its contents are listed in area <emphasis
	    role="bold">I</emphasis> and the file can then be saved
	    into this folder by clicking on the
	    <guibutton>Save</guibutton> button.
	  </para>
	</step>

        <step>
	  <title>
	    Navigating back up the folder tree using area <emphasis

	  <para>
	    If the sub-folder selected in area <emphasis
	    role="bold">I</emphasis> does not contain the branch of
	    the folder tree leading to the desired folder, the buttons
	    in area <emphasis role="bold">G</emphasis> can be used to
	    jump further up the folder tree but only as far as the
	    'relative root' folder selected in area <emphasis
	    role="bold">F</emphasis>. Area <emphasis
	    role="bold">G</emphasis> provides a list of buttons with
	    the names of all the folders between the 'relative root'
	    listed in area <emphasis role="bold">F</emphasis> and the
	    currently selected folder. By clicking on one of these
	    buttons, that is by placing the mouse pointer over the
	    button and clicking with the primary mouse button, the
	    folder listed on the button will be opened in area
	    <emphasis role="bold">I</emphasis> so that the selection
	    process can restart from this branch.

        The process of exploration of the folder tree can continue as

        Most of these formats are provided by plugins, which are
        independent, configurable modules. If a format described below
        does not appear in the <interface>File Save</interface>
        dialog, this may be because the appropriate plugin has not
        been configured or started. This can be verified by examining
        the list of plugins which are currently running in the
        <interface>Plugin Manager</interface> dialog.
      </para>

      <para>
        The <interface>Plugin Manager</interface> dialog lists the
        plugins which are currently in use and provides a way to start
        plugins which are currently disabled. The <interface>Plugin
        Manager</interface> can be started by selecting, in the
        <guimenu>Tools</guimenu> menu, the
        <guimenuitem>Plug-ins...</guimenuitem> menu item; see <xref
        linkend="sect-configuration-plugins" /> for more information.
