  <para>

  <para>
    Toolbars can be hidden or shown by clicking with the primary mouse
    button on the
    <guimenu>View</guimenu> menu, the dragging the pointer down to the
    <guimenuitem>Toolbars</guimenuitem> to open its submenu and then
    moving the pointer into the sub-menu listing the three
    toolbars. By default each toolbar appears with a small check mark
    in front of its name indicating that it is visible. Clicking on
    any of the toolbars will alter its setting, making the toolbar
    visible if it is hidden or hiding the toolbar if it is
    visible.
