  <para>
    Several preferences which relate to &gnum; as a whole can be
    configured and will affect the appearance and behaviour of the
    program every time it is run. These preferences can be set by the
    user.
  </para>

  <para>
    &gnum; provides a main preference configuration panel which allows
    users to configure fundamental properties of the program including
    the font used within the spreadsheet, the type of file generated
    when a workbook is saved, default settings for the tools and the
    'undo' mechanism, as well as several fundamental properties of the
    program, such as the pixel pitch of the display, which require
    advanced knowledge to understand. <xref
    linkend="sect-configuration-preferences"/> explains how to alter
    these preferences.
  </para>

  <para>
    The toolbars can also be configured by being hidden from
    view. This allows &gnum; to be fit into a smaller space. <xref
    linkend="sect-configuration-toolbars"/> explains how to hide or
    show each toolbar.
  </para>

  <para>
    Much of the functionality of &gnum; is provided through the plugin
    mechanism. Individual plugins can be disabled to save memory space
    or when the plugin computer code is being altered. <xref
    linkend="sect-configuration-plugins"/> explains how to disable
    and re-enable &gnum; plugins.
  </para>

  <para>
    &gnum; is designed to be used around the globe and therefore
    allows the use to determine the language for the menus and to
    determine location specific information such as the character used
    to separate whole numbers from fractional units. These language
    and locale settings are explained in <xref
    linkend="sect-configuration-localization"/>.
