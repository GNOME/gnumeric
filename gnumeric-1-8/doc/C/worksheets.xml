  <title>Overview</title>

  <para>
    Worksheets contain the elements, such as the cell grid area, which
    provide the principal work entities for &gnum; users. The
    worksheet grid area allows users to enter data, develop analyses
    of these data, and display both data and results. Worksheets also
    contain graphical elements such as graphs and widgets. The
    worksheets are themselves grouped into a workbook which will be
    stored in a &gnum; file. The manipulation of workbooks is
    explained in <xref linkend="sect-workbooks"/> while the material
    below explains the manipulation of worksheets.
  </para>

  <para>
    Worksheets contain both working elements and metadata
    elements. The working elements include the data contents of cells
    in the grid area, cell comments, cell formatting, and sheet
    objects, such as graphical plots. The metadata include the
    worksheet name and worksheet settings controlling the visual
    appearance of the worksheet or the display of the worksheet.
  </para>

  <para>
    This section explains the main ways to manipulate &gnum;
    worksheets. <xref linkend="sect-worksheets-navigation"/> explains
    how to navigate the worksheet to change the area which is
    displayed and change the currently selected area. <xref
    linkend="sect-worksheets-display"/> presents several alternative
    settings which alter the display of cell contents, of the grid
    area, of the worksheet as a whole or of &gnum; itself. <xref
    linkend="sect-worksheets-settings"/> explains how to alter
    settings which affect all the contents of the worksheet such as
    the status of the content protection mechanism. <xref
    linkend="sect-worksheets-printSettings"/> gives a brief
    explanation of the print settings which apply specifically to each
    worksheet; a more complete explanation of the print settings is
    given in <xref linkend="chapter-printing"/>. Finally, <xref
    linkend="sect-worksheets-managing"/> explains how the entire
    collection of worksheets can be manipulated so as to add,
    duplicate, delete or re-order the worksheets within a workbook.

<sect1 id="sect-worksheets-navigation">
  <title>Worksheet Navigation</title>

  <para>
    &gnum; worksheets can be conceived of as a single, continuous,
    two-dimensional grid of cells. However, &gnum; cannot display the
    entire grid at once but only shows a portion of the
    worksheet. Since only a portion of the worksheet can be seen at
    any particular time, &gnum; provides users with several ways to
    change the portion of the worksheet that is displayed. <xref
    linkend="sect-worksheets-navigation-selection"/> explains the
    various ways that the display window can be moved to a different
    section of the worksheet grid, while <xref
    linkend="sect-worksheets-display"/> , further below, explains more
    powerful methods to re-organize the display of the cell grid area.

  <title>Worksheet Display</title>

  <para>
    The display of each worksheet can be controlled by several
    settings and configurations. The worksheet, conceptually, consists
    of a single continuous two dimensional grid of cells arranged in
    65536 rows by 258 columns, and &gnum;, by default, displays a
    small portion of the worksheet area as a continuous region. This

    <para>
      The worksheet grid is 65536 rows by 258 columns of cells, by
      default. This can be changed but only by altering the computer
      program files and recompiling the code to make a new version of
      the &gnum; program.
