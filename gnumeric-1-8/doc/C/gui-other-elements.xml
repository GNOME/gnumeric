      <para>
        The cell indicator will show the address for the cell at the
        top left of the selected region. This address is listed in the
        standard column:row notation. The alphabetic part indicates
        the the column of this top leftmost cell and the numeric part
        indicates the row of this top left cell. For instance, the
        cell which is over three columns and down two rows is
        designated:</para> <blockquote><para>C2</para></blockquote>
        <para>This designation matches the column and row headers for
        this cell.
      </para>

      <para>
        While a region is being selected, the current cell indicator
        will change to show the size of the region which is being
        selected. This information is presented in a row number by
        column number format. For instance, this designation:
      
        <blockquote><para>15R x 6C</para></blockquote>
      
        would indicate a selection area 15 rows high by 6 columns
        wide. Once the mouse is released at the end of the selection,
        the current cell indicator goes back to giving the address of
        the single top leftmost cell.

      contents to the previous state. If a user decides in the middle
      of an edit that the data being entered into a cell is not what
      they want, the user can push this cancel button to cancel the
      current data and return the cell to the state it was at before.

    <para>
      The most common use of this button is when overwriting the contents
      of a cell with new data. If the user decided to revert the change
      before confirming it, the cancel button is the answer. Note that this 
      button works just like typing the escape key on the keyboard.

	<para>Each cell in this area is delimited by a light grey line
	by default.  The current selection is indicated by a
	rectangular box with a little box on the lower right, this
	case cell J12. The view in this figure shows the middle
	portion of a worksheet which is evident in two ways. Firstly,
	the column and row headers do not start at column A and row
	1. Secondly, the scroll thumbs are not at the top and
	left. The thumbs are the boxes within the scroll bars that are
	used to scroll. Note also that cell D19 has a comment within
	it which is shown by the little red triangle at the top right
	corner.</para>
	
	<para>The size of a cell is determined by the width of the
	column and height of the row that the cell is in. The columns
	and rows can be resized by acting on the header relevant to
	the cell. The user must move the mouse pointer to the edge of
	the header which is either to the right or below the cell.
	With the mouse pointer in this position, the pointer will
	change to a set of opposite pointing arrows. The user must
	then drag this edge away from the top left corner. This takes
	a little practice.</para>

<!-- TODO: add a screenshot. Explain selction, drag. -->
    <para>
      At the bottom of <xref linkend="cell-grid.png" />, Gnumeric has
      a tabbed sheet indicator. This is the boxes with the labels
      "Guppies", "Turtles", "Mermaids", "seahorses" and so on. In
      workbooks where there are more than one sheet, extra tabs are
      used to indicate how many sheets are there, and also allows the
      user to move to another sheet by clicking the proper tab. Each
      tab is a link to a separate worksheet within Gnumeric. In this
      figure, the "Turtles" tab has been selected. Gnumeric shows this
      by making the "Turtles" since the tab is a little bigger and
      making it overlap the two neighbouring tabs.
    </para>

    <para>
      On the far right, the two arrows indicate that there are more
      sheets in the workbook and more tabs for those
      sheets. Unfortunately, there is not enough space to show them
      all so Gnumeric displays these arrows. If all the sheets are
      visible, these arrows will not be displayed. These arrows can be
      used to scroll the tabs and bring tabs that were hidden into
      view. This may be a little difficult to understand and work with
      but becomes easier quickly.
