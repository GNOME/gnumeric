  <title>Cell format in Gnumeric</title>

  <para>Gnumeric provides a wide range of formating rules for the data
  that is entered into the cells.  The numbers are rendered according
  to a format code that describes the way you want the information to
  be presented.</para>

  <para>To apply a format to a cell, you need to select the range of
  cells to which a given style is going to be applied and then invoke
  the cell format dialog box.  The cell format dialog box can be
  activated from the main Gnumeric menu bar as Format/Cell or from the
  context-sensitive menu in the spreadsheet (this is activated by
  pressing the right button).</para>
