Description: spreadsheet application for GNOME - additional plugins
 Gnumeric is a spreadsheet application that interoperates well
 with other spreadsheets. It comes with plugins that enable it to deal with
 commonly used spreadsheet file formats.
 .
 Some plugins shipped with gnumeric require additional packages to those
 required by the main gnumeric program. These plugins are therefore
 packaged separately.
 .
 This includes:
  - Perl plugin;
  - Python plugin;
  - Python plugin loader;
  - additional Python functions;
  - GNOME glossary.
