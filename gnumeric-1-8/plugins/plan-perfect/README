This plugin will import a PlanPerfect spreadsheet (WordPerfect Corp's
spreadsheet which was later replaced with Quatro Pro). This is the
spreadsheet that was available from WordPerfect Corp for VAX/VMS,
and in their DOS Office products, until they were bought by Novell,
who replaced it with QuatroPro.

It handles strings, numbers and formula's, but most of the formatting
information is lost.
