.TH GNUMERIC 1 "September 14, 2003" gnumeric "GNOME"
.SH NAME
gnumeric \- a GNOME spreadsheet application.

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBgnumeric\fR [\fIOPTIONS\fR] [\fIfiles\fR \fI...\fR ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBGnumeric\fR is a powerful spreadsheet program created by the GNOME
project. \fBGnumeric\fR intends to compete with commercial
spreadsheets by becoming fully compatible with Microsoft Excel(TM) and
through the support of most popular spreadsheet file formats such as
Excel(TM), Lotus 1-2-3(TM), Applix(TM), Sylk(TM), XBase(TM),
Oleo(TM) and OpenOffice.org formats.

\fBGnumeric\fR supports advanced calculations using statistical,
financial and database access functions. Plotting data is supported
through an incomplete but powerful plotting system. A plugin system
extends \fBgnumeric\fR , for instance enabling the export of data to
the LaTeX \\longtable format. Plugins can be used to define custom
functionality. A rudimentary scripting API for the Python language
exists and will be extended in the near future. Since \fBgnumeric\fR
is \fBfree\fR software, \fBgnumeric\fR can also be extended directly
at the source code level by any competent programmer.

The program can be started from the command line as \fBgnumeric\fR or
from one of the menus provided by the underlying platform. When started
on the command line, \fBgnumeric\fR may be followed by the options listed
below and possibly the names of files in various spreadsheet formats
which will then be opened immediately. For instance, the command:

    gnumeric myfile.gnumeric

will launch \fBgnumeric\fR and open the file called
"myfile.gnumeric". The default \fBgnumeric\fR file format is in
extensible markup language (XML) which subsequently has been
compressed with \fBgzip\fR.

.SH USER OPTIONS
This program follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with single
letter options starting with a single dash (`-') and longer options
starting with two dashes (`--').

.SS "Help options"
.B \-?, \-\-help
Show help message.
.TP
.B \-\-usage
Displays a brief usage message.

.SS "Gnumeric options"
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-version
Displays the version number of the installed instance of
\fBgnumeric\fR.
.TP
.B \-\-no-splash
Start \fBgnumeric\fR without showing the splash screen.  The splash 
screen is normally shown if loading files takes too long.
.TP
\fB\-L, \-\-lib-dir=\fR\fISTRING\fR 
Set the root library directory to STRING which should be a pathname.
.TP
\fB\-D, \-\-data-dir=\fR\fISTRING\fR 
Adjust the root data directory to STRING which should be a pathname.

.SS "Options for window placement"
.TP
\fB\-g, \-\-geometry=WIDTHxHEIGHT+XOFF+YOFF 
Set the size and position of the first window. All units are in
pixels. The X offset is from the left hand side of the screen, the Y
offset is from the top of the screen. For example, \-g=800x600+20+30
will open a gnumeric window 800 pixels wide by 600 pixels high, with
the left edge of gnumeric 20 pixels from the left of the screen and
the top edge of gnumeric 30 pixels from the top of the screen.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-display=\fR\fIDISPLAY\fR
X display to use, where DISPLAY has the form
machinename:Xdisplay.Screen. Note that the machine displaying gnumeric
must have granted the machine running gnumeric the right to display
(see xhost).

.TP 
.B \fB\-\-screen=\fR\fISCREEN\fR
X screen to use, a more compact form of the functionality described
above.
