  <para>To reference the value stored in a single cell, B1 for example, just 
        enter "B1"
     as the function argument.</para>
  
  <para>Cells are referenced in a format like C4, where C is the column label
    and 4 is the row label.</para>

    <title>Absolute cell referencing</title>

    <para>Cells can be referenced in the default way (relative referencing),
      or by using absolute referening. Absolute referencing means that when the cell
      is copied, the cell reference does not change. Normally, autofilling a 
cell
      range or moving cell will change its cell reference to so that it maintains
      a relation to the original cell. With absolute cell referencing this, behaviour is
      overridden. </para>

    <para>The format for absolute cell refencing is to use a '$' in front of the
      cell coordinate that the user wants to stay constant. The column, row, sheet, or
      any combination of these can be held constant.</para>

    <example id="cell-refer-absolute-reference">
      <title>Absolute cell referencing examples</title>
      <programlisting>
	A1          Normal cell reference
	$A2         Hold the column value constant
	A$2         Hold the row value constant
	$A$2        Hold row and columns constant.
      </programlisting>
    </example>

    <title>Referencing multiple cells</title>
    
    <para>Many functions can take multiple cells as arguments. This can either
      be a comma separated list, an array, or any combination thereof.</para>
    
    <sect3>
      <title>Multiple individual cells</title>
      
      <para>A comma separated list of cell references can be used to
	indicate cells that are discontinuous.</para>
      
      
      <example id="cellrefermutiplecells">
	<title>Some examples of function syntax</title>
	<programlisting>
	  =SUM(A1,B2,C4)
	  
	  =MIN(A1,B2, C4,C5,D6)

      <title>Referencing a continuous region of cells</title>
      
      <para>For functions that take more than one argument, it is often
	easier to reference the cells as a group. This can include
	cells in sets horizontally, vertically, or in arrays.</para>
      
      <para>The ':' operator is used to indicate a range of cells. The basic
	syntax is upper left corner:bottom right corner. </para>

      <title>Referencing non-continuous regions</title>
	  
      <para>For referencing cells that are in non-continuous regions,
	    you can use any combination of the above methods to get
	the needed cells.</para>
      
      
	  <example id="cellreferdiscontin">
	<title>Referencing blocks of cells</title>
	<programlisting>
	  =SUM(A1:E1, B19, L14:L17)
	  
	  =AVERAGE(A1,A3, A5:C5)

  <sect2>
    <title>Referencing cells on other sheets</title>

    <para>It is possible to reference cells which are not part of the
    current sheet.  This is done using the NAME!CELL syntax,
    where NAME is an identifier (usually a sheet name) and CELL is a
    regular cell reference as described in the previous
    sections.</para>

    <para>Note that if NAME contains spaces, you need to quote the
    whole name to allow Gnumeric to group the separate words in NAME
    as single name.  For example, you should use "Sheet 0" when
    referencing the default created "Sheet 0".</para>

    <example id="simple-sheet-ref">
      <title>Referencing values in other sheets</title>
      <programlisting>
	='Sheet 0'!A1+'Sheet 3'!A5

	=SUM('Sheet 1'!A1:'Sheet 1'!A5)
      </programlisting>
    </example>
