    <para>
      With data shuffling tool you can shuffle data in a given cell
      range.  The tool can be started by selecting ``Shuffle'' menu
      item in ``Data'' menu.  In order to use the tool give the input
      range in which the data to be shuffled is stored.  The tool is
      able to shuffle the contents of the whole cell range, or, also
      shuffle data according to rows or columns. The shuffling method
      is selected under the ``Input Range'' entry. For example, if
      your data is grouped by rows then select ``Shuffle Method''
      ``Rows''.
    </para>

    <para>
      The default output method is to shuffle in-place. The shuffled
      data can also be written into a new sheet, new workbook, or into
      an existing sheet by giving the output range. If you select the
      ``Autofit Columns'' option, the width of each output column is
      automatically fixed according to the size of data in it.

    <para>
      With data filters you can select a subset of rows in the
      worksheet that meet the given criteria.  You can, for example,
      copy rows of a table containing sales of departments whose
      profit has been exceptionally high into a new sheet simply using
      a filter.</para>

      <title>Advanced Filter</title>

      <para>
        To use advanced filter, you should have a few blank rows
        available in your worksheet to be used as a criteria range.
        These rows should not overlap with the rows in the table to be
        filtered.
      </para>

     <para>Now copy all the column labels from the table you want to
     filter into the first blank row in the criteria range.  Below the
     criteria labels, you can now type the conditions you want to
     match for the particular label.  For example, under a label
     `Profit' you could type `>=1000'.  The tool selects only rows
     that match all the criteria.</para>

     <para>It is possible to have many conditions for a single label.
     For example, you can select the departments whose profit is
     either very high or very low.  To do this, type, for example,
     <![CDATA[ `<=0' below the `>=40000' ]]> condition.</para>

     <para>``Filter in-place'' writes the new table in-place.  Note
     that you will loose all the rows in the table that will not match
     the criteria.  ``Copy to a new location'' copies the selected
     rows into the same sheet but into the specified cell range.  Type
     the cell range into the ``Copy to'' entry if you want this action
     to happen.  The other options let you to copy the selected rows
     into a new sheet or a new workbook.</para>

     <para>You should then specify the cell range containing the table
     to be filtered in the ``List range'' entry.  The cell range
     containing the criteria is specified in the ``Criteria range''
     entry.  If the original table contains duplicate rows, you may
     also want to specify the ``Unique records only''.  If it is
     checked on, the filter removes all duplicates.</para>

     <para>To start the tool, you can then click the ``OK'' button and
     you will get the new table.</para>
