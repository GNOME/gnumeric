    The <guilabel>Plugin Manager</guilabel> is a tabbed dialog with
    three tabs. The first tab, labeled <guilabel>Plugin
    List</guilabel>, provides a list of all the currently
    visible plugins, the second tab, labeled <guilabel>Plugin
    Details</guilabel> provides details on the plugin selected in the
    first tab. The third tab, labeled <guilabel>Directories</guilabel>
    lists the directories which are currently searched to discover new
    plugins.
  </para>

  <para>
    The first tab provides a list of plugins, an explanation of each
    and a method to activate or de-activate the plugin. The list
    includes all of the plugins which have been found by &gnum; in the
    directories listed in the third tab. An explanation can be
    obtained for each plugin by selecting the plugin from the list by
    placing the mouse pointer over the plugin name and clicking with
    the primary mouse button. The explanation will then appear in the
    bottom text area. The active column provides check boxes in front
    of each listed plugin. If the box contains a check mark, the
    plugin has been activated and its functionality should be
    available.
