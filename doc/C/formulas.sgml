  <title>Formulas</title>
  
  <para>Formulas are the key to making a powerful spreadsheet. A formula can take almost anything as its arguments
    including single numbers, cell references, ranges of cells, arrays
    of cells, and more. </para>
    
  <sect2>
    <title>Syntax</title>
    
    <para> Formulas are distinguished from regular data by a '=' as
      the first character. Everything following a '=' is evaluated as
      a formula, not a string. </para>
    
    <para> The simplest fomula's just use the standard math operator
     and symbols. +,-,*,/ are intrepreted just as you would expect
     them to.  +,- can be used as unary operators and indicate sign,
     just as can be expected.</para>
      
    <example id="standardoperators">
      <title>Examples of standard operators</title>
      <programlisting>
	=5+5            returns 10.
	
	=5-4            returns 1.
	
	=-5             returns -5.
	
	=5*5            returns 25.
	
	=(5*5)+11       returns 36.
	
	=(5*)+(49/7)    returns 32.

    <title>Using Functions</title>
    
    <para>Most of the standard math, business, statistical, and
      scientific calculations are implemented in terms of
      functions. Functions are in the form of:</para>
    
    <example id="basicfunctionsyntax">
      <title>Basic Function syntax</title>
      <programlisting>
	=FUNCTION(ARGUMENTS)
      </programlisting>
    </example>
    
    <para> While the documentation generally refers to functions in all caps,
      their use is not actually case sensitive.</para>
	
	<example id="functionsyntax">
	  <title>Some examples of function syntax</title>
	  <programlisting>
	    =SUM(A1,A2,A4,B5)
	    
            =AVERAGE(A1:A16)
	    
            =EXP(1)
	    
	    =PI()
	    
            =MIN(A1,A2,B6)
	  </programlisting>
	</example>

	<para>Where a function takes multiple arguments such as the
	SUM example, the number of arguments effectively unlimited.</para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2>
  <title>Names</title>
  <para>Names help to simplify complex formulae. A name is assinged to
  a formula which will be evaluated when it is referred to in another
  formula. Names are particularly useful for labeling cell ranges.</para>

	<example id="namesyntax">
	<title>Examples of name usage</title>
	<para>If DataBase is defined as '$A$1:$B$500' and
	E_Constant is defined as 2.71828182845 then we can have:</para>
  	  <programlisting>
	    =VLOOKUP (C1, "gnu", DataBase, 2, 0)

	    =LN(E_Constant)

	    =SUM(DataBase, E_Constant)
	  </programlisting>
	</example>

  <para>Names are defined using the <guimenu>Insert</guimenu>
  <guimenuitem>Name</guimenuitem> dialog. This allows manipulation of
  all the names in the related workbook. A name is restrained from taking
  that of a function, since this would cause confusion.</para>

  <para>In addition to the names you define there are built in names:</para>
  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem><para>"Sheet_Title:" this returns the name of the current sheet</para></listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  </sect2>

  <sect2>
    <title>Array Formulas</title>
    
    <para>It is periodically useful or necessary to have an expression return
    a matrix rather than a single value.  The first example most people think
    of are matrix operations such as multiplication, transpose, and inverse.
    A less obvious usage is for data retrieval routines (databases, realtime
    data-feeds) or functions with vector results (yield curve calculations).
    </para>
    
    <example id="arrayformulacreate">
      <title>Entering an Array Formula</title>
	<para>An array formula is currently entered by selecting the single
	range in which to store the result, entering the array formula,
	and hitting the magic combination, Ctrl-Shift-Enter.
	</para>
	<para>The result is displayed as :</para>

      <programlisting>
	={FUNCTION(ARGUMENTS)}(num_rows, num_cols)[row number][col number]
      </programlisting>
    </example>
