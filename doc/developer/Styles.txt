A discussion of the new Style code

	In order to solve several of the problems associated with blank cells
and to simplify the way styles are handled the following approach has been
adopted:

1.1	How to use the new code:

	A new style element array is used see: sheet.h:MStyle,
mstyle.h: MStyleElement.

	In order to apply a Style to a region the following steps are needed

	a) Create the style:

	   MStyle *style = mstyle_new (NULL);

		The NULL pointer is for future expansion with named styles,
	and should always be NULL for now.

	b) Add elements:

	   MStyleElement e;
	   e.type = MSTYLE_FONT_NAME;
	   e.u.font.name = g_strdup ("My font name");
	   mstyle_add (style, e);

		So, a new style element is created, and ( this being a nasty
	case ) it is neccessary to duplicate the pointer you pass. NB. this
	also applies to things such as StyleColors, these need to be
	referenced if you plan to put _the same_ style color pointer into
	lots of different style elements ( this would be an odd thing to do )

	c) Specify the range:

	   Range range

	   range.start.col = 0;
	   range.start.row = 0;
	   range.end.col   = 5;
	   range.end.row   = 5;

		This specifies A1:F6.

	d) Attach it to the sheet:

	   sheet_style_attach (sheet, range, style);
	
	Alternatively, if you are feeling evil and want to make life difficult
	then use:

	   cell_set_style (cell, style);
	
	be aware that this _drasticaly_ fragments the style space, so every
	now and then you need to do a:

	   sheet_style_optimize (sheet, Range);

	where Range covers a small range that you have set styles in that
	overlaps with the last range you called optimize on by 1 col/row.
	This will auto-coalesce your ranges, but is of order 3*n*n where n
	is the number of styles in the range. Be warned.

1.2	Discussion of how it works

		At the moment the short answer is read the code, you will
	need to see:

	     sheet-style.c ( all ), mstyle.c ( all )
	     style.c:style_mstyle_new.

	        style_mstyle_new is a function to ease transition to the new
	style architecture, and will in due course be phased out I think,
	for now it is used to map an MStyleElement array to an old fashion
	'Style *'.
